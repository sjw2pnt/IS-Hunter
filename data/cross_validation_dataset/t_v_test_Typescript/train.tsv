OP	I had trouble with the new version 0.8.7  it would not sync properly , it was syncing but was so slow it would never have cought up with it's self . I have now gone back to 0.8.6 .Could my problems have been due to the hard fork as that was the reason i updated to 0.8.7 ? Seeing as the Gethub site said the update was for those that use Mist and did not effect those that are just using the wallet as it does not access the internet. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I have read that others also had trouble syncing the new version 0.8.7 and that is the reason i stop trying with 0.8.7 and went back to 0.8.6 . I think it may follow the wrong Chain at block 1,346,??? not shore about that but the chain data started to bloat and get very big conpared to the size of the chain data that i currently have with 0.8.6 that was up to date as of about 36 hrs ago __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I also had trouble with 0.8.6 the first time . It would not sync . I then use Gerth and reved DB and then reloaded it the chain data with this command geth --fast --support-dao-fork --cache=512 --maxpeers 99 --jitvm and this worked __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Don't know what you have done but i am getting F-ing pissed off with the wallet not syncing and what the hell has the wallet downloaded new binary's ?????? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Geth folder now has to folders with binary's what the hell is the new binay for , i now have 3 versions of geth 2 in the folder Geth in there own folders and 1 version in the geth folder. So witch version is the correct one we should be using ????????????????????????????????????????? F-me you just can't help yourself but F-up every month or 2 can you ! __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

NF	just read the news so the chain split , well i can report i just ran the new grth and it's even worse the the origanal version that is loaded with 0.8.6 . In other words i don't think the patch is working . I am not using Mist just the wallet __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

FD	what's the bet the stuff up has been caused by Zcash being linked with ether it is the same group that''s released Zcash that is doing ether . __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

AE	gtx 970 using Nicehash cuda 8 gives only 19 sols , I have just run Zcash for 24 hrs with everything going  gtx 970 using cuda and 680 using open cl as it wont work with the cuda and 4 of 8 cores running got me 0.00501 Zcash  good luck with that one as it seems only big miners with heaps of cash to buy the latest CPU's and you will need at least 20 will be able to mine it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	ops the latest GPU's and you will need at least 20 will be able to mine it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	if you wish to do anonomous transcation then use Dash coin and don't worry about Zcash __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	you can mine Dash a lot easyer than Zcash and is more profitable too __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	Good night i will leave the wallet to sync as it does seem to be syncing but very slowly and the Chain data has grown by 1.3 gig for only aprox 3,200 blocks witch does not seem right , there is still 7,00 to go so i will check it in a few hours but i suspect that the patch does not work with 0.8.6 or does not do what you thought it would do __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	so i'll let it finish see how big the chain gets note it down and then redo the whole thing and see how big the chaindata folder is and let you know , if it is smaller then your patch is not working but i will let you know tomorrow so good night __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	If I've got a docker container running docker (teamcity agent running builds) what is the best way to mount a volume in the 'parent' container into the 'child' container? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	The 'parent' container has the host docker socket bound (-v /var/run/docker.sock:) so when the agent (parent container) tries to run a new container and pass some -v flags; the -v flags don't get mounted correctly as far as I can tell __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

IG	Trezamere: I haven\'t actually messed with volumes in that manner, but have you tried using "volumes_from" by creating a sibling of the parent container that maps in the volumes from the host you want to use and then having the spun up agents using  volumes_from? __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	i would like to dockerize a project that consist of:a frontend codebase (angular 2, after npm run build all the STATIC files i need is in the dist directory)\na backend codebase (a nodejs app w/o any transpilation build process)the production nginx.conf file looks like this: [<-CODE->] the backend api got a dependency for mongodb, so i will need a node, mongo, nginx Dockerfile __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OP	quick question... __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
OP	is there a way to docker monitor if a service inside the container is alive or not? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I mean, the main ENTRYPOINT is alive, so from docker perspective, the container is running however, some internal crap happen on the app and I need docker to check with some sort of heartbeat the application (idk, a ping on a specific port or whatever) and if it does'nt reply, just kill the container... is it possible? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	need some health monitoring internal and external to the container; something internal to keep checking the status of what you need running/accessible, and something external to poll it once in a while to know to kill/restart it.... there's unfortunately so many ways to accomplish this, it just depends on what level of effort you want to put into it. __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	you could simplyexecaps | grep APPto see if it's running external from container on the host __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

CC	that is the poin __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	point __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	in Orleans we have a health monitoring service which all nodes of the cluster ping each other and after a given number of ping fail from some servers, they declare it dead, and remove from the cluster membership ring __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	it already works pretty fine on VMs and bare metal __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I did implemented an Docker membership provider __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem now is that for the provider, it only knows if a node is up or down only by checking docker daemon if it is up or down __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	and that is our problem __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FQ	a container can be app, but some internal thread in the application process for whatever reason is blocked __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so no new requests should go to that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so the idea is to ask docker (or swarm) to kill that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	but to be sure of that, I need to detect this stallness correctly __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	how is the provider checking daemon status? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	remember, i know nothing about Orleans, so my apologies for simpleton questions related to that __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
GG	nah no worries :D __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
GG	that is another problem :D __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	if you are simply doing adocker ps | grep MY_CONTAINER_NAME | grep Runningor something of the nature, it's simple to also do something like:docker exec MY_CONTAINER_NAME ps aux | grep processordocker exec MY_CONTAINER_NAME ping somehost.com __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	in linux, you map docker.socket and you make docker API requests to it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	but on windows, there is no docker.socket!!! o.o __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	imo it's best to keep that check external to the container... i like to couple things downstream instead of upstream... but that's preference __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	we have this check external __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	each node of Orleans cluster (which is a container) send health messages to each other __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the rendevour point of those messages, used to be the membership table __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	if multiple nodes try to reach a node and fail (lets say 3 times), that node is marked as dead __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	even if the machine is running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so noone will send a message to it again __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	now, in docker, we don't have that table __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	we were relying on docker labels __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so each Orleans node should query docker (or swarm) daemon periodically about all the containers with a given Label that are running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	that would make them know who is on the cluster __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	if a container is killed/exit, next query on docker api will return all containers - that one __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	that is ok for periodic refreshes and consider only the container up or down __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is internal __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I need to mark a container as dead even if it is running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	could you then iterate over all the containers and exec a "health check" script that is consistently implemented? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CQ	even if it does NOTHING? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	the problem is not the healthcheck mecanism __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	we already have it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is how to mark it as dead __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	errr, other than just killing the container? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CQ	or can you modify a label? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	ok way, let me rephrase __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	i haven't messed with labels really outside of RancherOs __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is how to save the counted votes to kill that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	so my knowledge there is low as well, other than you can kinda query against them __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	remember, before docker, we had that table as a central point __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	hi! does anyone happen to know about inspecting execution state in a container? when you execa command you can see the exec id in the container state, and the docker API allows you to query that state (e.g. to see whether it’s running) but I don’t see any docs for command line support __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	the autoencoder example is quite simple... so I have still plenty of questions. first of all, there are many types of autoencoders such as Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder, Contractive autoencoder... which does DL4J support?do I need to do something special to make an autoencoder that is  Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder or Contractive autoencoder? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	variational autoencoder now available at current master __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	alex merged it few days ago __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	nice! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	daredemo: There are small special things for each of the subtypes of autoencoders.  Sparse has a penalty (usually L1) which encourages sparse activation in the inner-most hidden layer.  Denoising adds noise on the input and attempts to reconstruct a noise free output.  Variational autoencoders instead learn a mean and standard deviation instead of an explicit internal state, then randomly generate a hidden state from those values and reconstruct. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	Of the bunch, denoising is perhaps the easiest to train, since you just had to do train(myExamples + noise, myExamples) __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

AE	but it doesn't seem to be used much. I'm also thinking about the use of npm for frontend modules. It seems like we are going to need to have better tracking of javascript version or we'll be in javascript version hell, or be stuck with publishing only es5 modules forever. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AE	protometa: I'm fine with es5 . But as an example of a variation - somereact-nativemodules are published as is and if you need to use them in other environments you need to use only single presetbabel-preset-react-native __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
AE	ewnd9: that works if you know a specific module or set of modules is pure es6 or es7 but seems like we need a more general solution for module consumers to know which version of javascript a module uses. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AE	rather than making it a concern of newer modules to covert for older consumers the older consumers could just convert newer modules that they wish to use. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	I think, I have something important to say.It's the second time that this happens with me. I install docker on Linux Mint and after some hours the disk is full. Dont know why this happens, but I found out one thing, that also happens these two times. I lost all my system backups (I use timeshift). I dont know if it's some kind of conflit, but I think I have to report this, because it's a shame. The last time I had to reinstall my system, because I couldnt even start the system. This time, when I realise I had just 6GB left, I deleted some stuff here to have at least 20GB free, then disconnect from internet, restart, delete all docker images (Yes, I installed yesterday and I downloaded 4 images) then uninstall docker, and the magic happens. 100GB free right now ... Someone tells me. How this is even possibel that docker uses 100GB ? I was watching the free space decreasing. C'mon. Fix that.

OP	Trying to get modules working properly in our app. Currently stuck at our collection of pipes, gathered in a PipeModule. If I import the module in multiple other modules that use the pipes I get an error sayingFooPipe is part of the declaration of 2 modules: PipeModule and PipeModule. If I only import it in our AppModule I get errors saying angular cant find the pipe. Am I missing something obvious here? o.O __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	still struggling to grasp the concepts to design a RNN networklet\'s say I wanted to detect motions/swipes on "touch pad" that consists of n x n sensors that record the state at a given interval. The users obviously do not make the motions identically, including the speeds might be different. So, now I have two questions:1) should I use a single n x n conv layer as input? or should I use some mega large input that contains all the n x n frames until the slowest motion is completed?2) if I used just single n x n as input, how should the training labeling be done? logically it seems that the label should be when the motion is completed, that is in the end, but should the other frames from the first to the last frame also be labeled the same? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	daredemo: You could use a CNN to obtain a single vector representation and then feed that into an RNN. Another approach I think of is to capture touchpad "activation" in a single matrix and let them decay with each timestep, so that most recent values will be 1 and old values will be close to zero and then apply a CNN to that single matrix. The problem with tihs approach is that you would need to detect start and end (maybe with another net?) __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	Paranaix: "You could use a CNN to obtain a single vector representation", could you elaborate on this? do you mean by this that would build input layer that is m frames deep? [m x n x n] if my frame is [n x n ]? because this seems a bad idea, as it would require a lot of computing each step. some kind of hidden Markov model would be preferred, when I would only need to know the previous state, not m previous states __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	daredemo: [n x n] -- CNN --> [m x 1] ---> RNN __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

CC	Yes but with an RNN afterwards __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CQ	Or did you mean that? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CC	of course, the beginning of my question implied that I'm doing RNN :D __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FQ	but if I use the [ n x n ] input, I\'m then struggling with the "2)": how do I label my data?when the finger touches the middle of the touch pad, it could then move anywhere, up down left right; so it would seem strange to label it as "up" even if it is part of "up" motion... or should I? or should those intermediate steps be all classified as "meh?" :D or some intermediate classifier like "doing up" and only the end would be "up"? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hey guys, I have one last question around spark's word2vec implementation (newest version). Is there anyway to update existing weights, like the standalone word2vec version? For example, if I start with a corpus of 1 gb, then add 500 more mbs at a later time, can it do so without overwriting the existing vocab and inMemoryLookupTable? If not, is there a way to merge two lookup tables? (I know you can add vocab cache, but I don't see anything for the inMemoryLookupTable). __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

IG	@sayedrakib If your components are siblings then try to send event to the parent component to initialize the results to some variable say <srch_results> and using the bindings for the results component set one to get <srch_results>  and do what ever you want with that data in your results component.You can do it via services, Observables too.But if the results is a child component then you can do it directly thinking a bit will give you the sol.And for more on this read about component interacion cookbook on angular 2 website.https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/component-communication.html __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	I'm new to docker and have been working at getting react-starter-kit up and running for dev and prod using docker-compose. I keep running into issues no matter how I seem to go about it.

FD	Easier question.... for those looking to use docker for dev workflows that use hot reloading/auto reloading.... is there a best practise for node_modules folder? I mean the node_modules folder needs to be compiled on the container but conversely I need to setup a volume for the src so hot reloading works. Seems odd tonpm iinto a tmp folder in the dockerfile and then get docker-compose to copy that over into the host machine volume. Not to mention that folder being leftover after compose is shut down. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	So when I run a docker instance, my entrypoint runs some bootstrapping commands to sync dependancies (specifically php'scomposer install).  These dependencies are written to disk owned by root:root. Is there a way to tell docker (specifically docker-compose) to write files as the user I'm running docker as? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	Looks like docker-composer supports auserkey in the yaml file. I'll try it out, but it would be nice if there was an agnostic way to let all developers run the same config. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	sbbowers__twitter: typically this is construct you create inside your container that picks up the user running the container's ID and chown all the files inside the container to that user during the build __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	dragon788: So the "standard approach" is to bake in "gosu" into all of your docker images by curling a binary off the net and then require your entrypoint to run the command through that, which gives you the option of passing an environment variable with the ID of your current user, all of which won\'t work with docker-compose. Do I understand that right? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	I think gosu is one way to do it, but really since it isn't recommended to run as root anyways, a lot of containers will chmod everything to a known user and run everything as that, the trick is whether that UID exists on your system or not __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FQ	So the easy way would to do auseradd -u {some arbitrary ID I pick} docker-useron the host and then pass that user ID to docker's -u? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	If I specify "docker-user" to docker, will it resolve the ID from the host, or does it do a useradd and create a new user? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

IG	jtco1010: separate from the fact that "codebase size" doesn\'t correlate to anything meaningful, node uses v8 as a dependency, so node is "node + v8" __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

AE	I will read these.  I believe Angular 1 one-time binding was so you could write data to the template, but then not have it check for updates in change detection later.  That is, once angular set the value in the template, it would not update it later. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
