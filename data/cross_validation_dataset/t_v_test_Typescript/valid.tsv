OQ	Hello everyone ! Im also new to DL4J, tried some stuff, read about it and really like it :) . But what im currently struggling with is how to enable multi label data input in DL4J (an useful example would be tag prediction from an image) . For inputs with a single label i used the PathLabelGenerator, which was fine. Since Google and reading the docs did not help much (apart from redirecting to gitter :P ), i decided to ask here. __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

CC	you mean they check themselves, not the containers __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	K8s and Rancher has healthchecks for their "services" and swarm simply checks that all containers have a healthy state. And as long as every container has a healty state all containers work as expected and everything from outside is L4 mesh magic :D __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
AE	i think he's saying they check the container's health status based on the result of that HEALTHCHECK entry as likely listed bydocker inspect, and have an option to auto-kill the container should it be unhealthy __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FQ	There are 2 types of health check. Local, where if unhealthy, just suicide(the HEALTHCHECK is a good candidate for that) and the distributed consensus, which is made by external sources trying to reach that container and failing, so they agree on ask docker to kill it __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hi guys. I am trying to combine angular 2 with .net mvc 5 and I seem to lack some basic understanding here regarding npm. I have so far only used angular2 combined with meteor so I didn't have to deal with this things...Do I need to have node.js on the server for deployment? Like locally in development I just install my packages with npm install etc. in node_modules. But for deployment I don't want to have node.js there, can I just bundle node_modules somehow or how does it work? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	bergben: I would assume where you are deploying would have node installed - for example on Heroku you provide build instructions and your package.json file and it does the rest.  I believe digital ocean works the same way.  I have not done it in a while so I am recalling this from memory __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	bergben: you need node at build time, and you should be deploying an archived tarball to production __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	I understand I need it at build time, but I would rather build it beforehand and then deploy the build. By now I am thinking about bundling the whole node_modules using [<-LINK->] and then just include that file... Do you think that would work? Or how do you mean "deploying an archived tarball", how would I do that@ljharb?@maxwellsmart84I know how it works for Heorku, unfortunately this project is for a company for a client on a custom server and communicating them to install node.js and npm then do npm install etc. just makes it complicated for them and should be avoided at all costs __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

PF	maxwellsmart84: Thanks though, I appreciate your effort! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	bergben: you're definitely supposed to build, tar up the build, and then deploy that archive later __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	So I'm trying to figure out a way to build images that arecompletedbuilds for my rails app deployments. I've basically read a bunch of stuff and come to the conclusion that I should create an image that has all my base dependencies like ruby version, nodejs, etc. Then i should create a dockerfile using that image as base, then copying over my 'tmp' directory that contains build cache, my 'node_modules' dir that contains previously downloaded javascript dependencies, and similarly so for my gems, and my javascript and image/css precompiled assets. After copying them into the image i can run my ruby 'build' tasks, then save all the new tmp, node_modules etc contents back to the host computer filesystem, and finish off the dockerfile. __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	If i'm not mistake this can give me very fast build times with minimal downloading etc and leads to a single image that I can spin up on any number of machines very quickly __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	does this approach make any sense? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	apologies for the lack of sensible terminology. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	if you want to leverage caching of build tasks, yes, that's the best solution. But to release a container for production, I usually remove build tools and ship the container with the minimum to run the service. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

FD	i thought you ship images, and when you run them you end up with a container on the host system __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

IG	"feature" I think, as you also get to read people's messages instantly and when they make edits it sends a new message to your client rather than "fixing" the old one, so you can see everybody's dirty minds :D __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	also I don't understand how distributing images works. Ithinkwhat happens is that you 'push' an image to a repo, which is actually sending meta data + a bunch of layersafterchecking the repo to see if it already has those layers or not. As in it only sends up what it needs to __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	is that correct? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	well the scary part was the hacks I saw to get specific layers not to cache __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	which I undrestand busts everything after __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	siassaj: you are correct, if you are building on top of the same base layer for a specific image "repository" then it will already have that base layer if you have previous pushed an image to it, then it only has to transfer the newer/different layers __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
