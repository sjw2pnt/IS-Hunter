CC	of course, I do also use freenode, but everyone loves gitter more than freenode. I especially like the public logging of channels Gitter does, which is something that freenode doesn't have or even encourage by default. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	me too - but for something I am working on gitter works better __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	I wouldn't mind having some sort of bridge from Gitter to my freenode channel, which I already have public logging for. I would consider my logs to be canonical. I wouldn't care if Gitter logs the channel as well. It's more about having an easy way for people to jump into the channel and start talking. __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AE	We tried same room.io which is close - but makes it come through one user, which is odd. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	Yeah, I haven't quite been satisfied with the user experience so far. For now, I just stook up an instance of Shout so people have an easy way to connect to the freenode channel from a web browser. No freenode captcha, no having to think about which channel to join. You just pick a username and start talking. Works pretty well. __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

OQ	Good morning all. What are the limitations of integration deployment within rooms? Seemingly anyone can add integrations to any room but I haven't seen any events show up in any room where I'm a member, or otherwise. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Oh and while I'm thinking about it, both the android and iOS apps will blank out the content of a room (right pane empty, right header still visible). In such cases the only way to recover is to switch to another room and switch back, sometimes more than once to get the content to reappear. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

NF	 [<-LINK->] @DKuriloYou can't, there is only chat mode on mobile. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
IG	DKurilo: there is a workaround, if you type some text and move your cursor into the middle of the text and press the enter key it will give you a new line and not send a text, at least on Android __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	And only sometimes __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	howdy... just joined gitter today in order to work with the Plone community.  i got connected to the IRC bridge, and it works okay... however, my client is being queried (/who) once per minute, littering my logs with useless messages. Is that expected/normal?   Also, it would super nifty if that bridge could (optionally? bi-directionally?) convert '<nick>:' at the start of a line to '@<nick>', so as  to improve interoperability between the two conventions of addressing individuals in a room. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hello everyone. Why does Gitter client have such a high energy impact on mac OS? It constantly reports as high energy impact and that it requires the discrete graphics chip on macbook pro __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	This is while running in the gitter client and while running in safari. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	running in Chrome does not appear to have that issue __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	I've also noticed a lot of spinning when posting messages with markdown on a very slow or flaky network/internet connection __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
OQ	is this some issue with gitter client itself or more likely a safari/webkit issue? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->] __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	I’m not educated on this topic, but could it be that the Gitter client is just an Electron wrapper? __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Because, if that’s the case, you’re running another instance of Chrome. But again, this is just speculation. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

IG	lisbetho: some organizations use a "Lobby" room that is org specific, and then they have additional rooms for each repository, but you can also set up rooms around topics as well (see FreeCodeCamp for examples) __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	I am new here. I really like this approach of an app directed at community-building. However I feel that the homepage does not do a great job of communicating this. Also, it took me a while to figure out how easy to go into a room and try it out. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OF	I really like gitter, and was thinking "what about a more compact theme ?" __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the "chat" zone is ok, but a more compact "left" zone may be a good option __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	for touch device, the tall "contact" items in lists is great but on a computer, the more I have on screen, the better it is __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
OQ	What do you think about it ? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->] __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	that was a quick "console hack" but I think space is important. Scrolling to find a room/person is really boring now :) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	And with all this space, adding separators or categories may be interesting __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
UF	mtancoigne: thanks …  __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
NF	maybe boring, but if scrolling will be desirable or required then a scroll bar and scroller should be visible. (If there's a bar in your shot, I can't see it.) __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

OQ	hi, trying to use the android app login via Github, and it's stuck at Two-factor authentication, waiting to receive an SMS but nothing coming. Is this only usable on a phone (and not a tablet with no SIM) ? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
