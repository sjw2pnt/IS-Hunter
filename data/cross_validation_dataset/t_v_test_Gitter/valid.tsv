OP	before 2.0, in order to usePromises in TS we would need to targed ES6 at tsconfig… if the target browser requires ES5, then we need to use babel to transpile again to ES5… so basically we had TS -> ES6 -> Babel -> ES5… so, did it changed with TS 2.0+ so we can usePromisein TS and target directlyh ES5?

I also installed nginx as a container and served the nginx to Caddy to see if Caddy is proxying correctly. I get the welcome screen from nginx.

OP	I had trouble with the new version 0.8.7  it would not sync properly , it was syncing but was so slow it would never have cought up with it's self . I have now gone back to 0.8.6 .Could my problems have been due to the hard fork as that was the reason i updated to 0.8.7 ? Seeing as the Gethub site said the update was for those that use Mist and did not effect those that are just using the wallet as it does not access the internet. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I have read that others also had trouble syncing the new version 0.8.7 and that is the reason i stop trying with 0.8.7 and went back to 0.8.6 . I think it may follow the wrong Chain at block 1,346,??? not shore about that but the chain data started to bloat and get very big conpared to the size of the chain data that i currently have with 0.8.6 that was up to date as of about 36 hrs ago __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

AC	Good night i will leave the wallet to sync as it does seem to be syncing but very slowly and the Chain data has grown by 1.3 gig for only aprox 3,200 blocks witch does not seem right , there is still 7,00 to go so i will check it in a few hours but i suspect that the patch does not work with 0.8.6 or does not do what you thought it would do __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	so i'll let it finish see how big the chain gets note it down and then redo the whole thing and see how big the chaindata folder is and let you know , if it is smaller then your patch is not working but i will let you know tomorrow so good night __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	the autoencoder example is quite simple... so I have still plenty of questions. first of all, there are many types of autoencoders such as Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder, Contractive autoencoder... which does DL4J support?do I need to do something special to make an autoencoder that is  Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder or Contractive autoencoder? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

FD	alex merged it few days ago __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	nice! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	daredemo: There are small special things for each of the subtypes of autoencoders.  Sparse has a penalty (usually L1) which encourages sparse activation in the inner-most hidden layer.  Denoising adds noise on the input and attempts to reconstruct a noise free output.  Variational autoencoders instead learn a mean and standard deviation instead of an explicit internal state, then randomly generate a hidden state from those values and reconstruct. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

CC	Z3roCoder: you should wrap your code in ``` __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so it's readable __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
UF	There we go :) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	interfaces aren't exclusive __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	they only require properties be there __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it doesn't care about extra properties __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	But in case 2 and 3, it requires exactly the properties in the interface __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	b is not in the interface, and this it complains that b shouldnt be there __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	return{a : 3 b:3}satisfies the interface __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	Look at my screenshot __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
NF	oh ... on object literals yeah __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	you need to do any on object literals if you want it to work __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So this is expected behaviour? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PF	yes __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's mostly designed for when you are passing object literals to function __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	When is, and when isn't, something a object literal in my example? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Isn't <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; also a object literal? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	yeah but then you are casting it specifically to an ITest __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So what's the difference then betweenreturn <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; andconst c: ITest = { a: 3, b: 3 } (This complains) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	what version are you using? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	2.1.4 __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	So the thinking is if you are setting extra properties you'll never be able to safely access them from the interface that you are assigning __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so the compiler assumes this is likely an error on your part __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	and you have to use type assertion to get around it __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	Why would this not apply to test4 then? This is basically the same example as test3, only that in this case, a Promise of the type ITest is returned __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

CC	you mean they check themselves, not the containers __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	K8s and Rancher has healthchecks for their "services" and swarm simply checks that all containers have a healthy state. And as long as every container has a healty state all containers work as expected and everything from outside is L4 mesh magic :D __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
AE	i think he's saying they check the container's health status based on the result of that HEALTHCHECK entry as likely listed bydocker inspect, and have an option to auto-kill the container should it be unhealthy __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FQ	There are 2 types of health check. Local, where if unhealthy, just suicide(the HEALTHCHECK is a good candidate for that) and the distributed consensus, which is made by external sources trying to reach that container and failing, so they agree on ask docker to kill it __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	I think, I have something important to say.It's the second time that this happens with me. I install docker on Linux Mint and after some hours the disk is full. Dont know why this happens, but I found out one thing, that also happens these two times. I lost all my system backups (I use timeshift). I dont know if it's some kind of conflit, but I think I have to report this, because it's a shame. The last time I had to reinstall my system, because I couldnt even start the system. This time, when I realise I had just 6GB left, I deleted some stuff here to have at least 20GB free, then disconnect from internet, restart, delete all docker images (Yes, I installed yesterday and I downloaded 4 images) then uninstall docker, and the magic happens. 100GB free right now ... Someone tells me. How this is even possibel that docker uses 100GB ? I was watching the free space decreasing. C'mon. Fix that.

OQ	Hello everyone ! Im also new to DL4J, tried some stuff, read about it and really like it :) . But what im currently struggling with is how to enable multi label data input in DL4J (an useful example would be tag prediction from an image) . For inputs with a single label i used the PathLabelGenerator, which was fine. Since Google and reading the docs did not help much (apart from redirecting to gitter :P ), i decided to ask here. __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	Funny, someone else asked a very similar question a while ago about predicting multiple classes __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	I think the only way is to take the n classes with the highest probabilities after the softmax step __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Maybe have a threshold on minimum probability and take all the classes with at least that probability __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	But I take it you want to assign multiple labels to examples during training time. No idea how that would work honestly. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Except maybe copying the examples that have multiple labels, one copy for every label you want to associate it with __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	Hi guys. I am trying to combine angular 2 with .net mvc 5 and I seem to lack some basic understanding here regarding npm.

But for deployment I don't want to have node.js there, can I just bundle node_modules somehow or how does it work? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	bergben: I would assume where you are deploying would have node installed - for example on Heroku you provide build instructions and your package.json file and it does the rest.  I believe digital ocean works the same way.  I have not done it in a while so I am recalling this from memory __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
