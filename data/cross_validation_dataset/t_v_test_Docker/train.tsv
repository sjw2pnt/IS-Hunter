IG	local can be string or INamespaceso{ space: namespaces[prefix], local }can be{ Inamespace, string }which is againts your function type __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	hmm general advice you should not be declaring types everywhere __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	{ space: namespaces[prefix], local }can be{ string, INamespace | string } __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PF	yes, that.  unless you cast local to string __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AC	Well I want to define it as accurate as possible __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so I have a good definition file as well __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	actually I think I need to use generics somehow because of the different input leads to different output __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
NF	probably not __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	 [<-CODE->] __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	you are killing the return type of the thing by declaring it as a functions __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FD	and I started with the namespaces.js and so on __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
JK	hmm __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	1st thing you should just replace imports and exports __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	let the things untyped __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	oh its already in es6 modules __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-CODE->] this one is a bit tricky. see they return functions which reference "this" __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	its a good idea that you turn on "noImplicitThis", and the functions cannot be converted to arrow format there [<-CODE->] __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hi guys, I have a simple question.  We can define some attribute in class likename?: stringwhich means that it may or may not be present. So is there any compiler flag or anything in typescript which will force me to do a type check before using it. For example handle the null case and to handle the case when name is a string? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	rajdeep26: Sortof. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	the closest would be turning on strict null checks __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	it won't catch every use, only mis-uses. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
CC	that will not force me to do a type check or empty check before using right? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	the type for an optional property likename?: stringwould bestring | undefined __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	so for example if you try to do [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	that would fail __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	sincestring | undefined is not assignable tostring __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Also it would  prevent you from doing object WithOptionalName.name.length __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	without first doing a check for object WithOptionalName.name !== undefined __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
UF	Thanks@dtabuenc __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
PF	Pretty close to what i was looking. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	yes it's highly encouraged to have strict null checks on on any new project __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	harder sometimes to get an existing project up to a state where you can turn that on though __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	that's why it's not the default __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	ya, we just started with a new project a week back __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	then I would recommend turning all the optional features on __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	no Implicit. Any no Implicit Returns no Implicit This strict Null Checks no Unused Locals no Unused Parameters no Fall through Cases In Switch __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	they really make your code much safer, and it's easy to comply with them if the codebase is new __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

AE	protometa: I'm fine with es5 . But as an example of a variation - somereact-nativemodules are published as is and if you need to use them in other environments you need to use only single presetbabel-preset-react-native __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

AE	rather than making it a concern of newer modules to covert for older consumers the older consumers could just convert newer modules that they wish to use. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

IG	foxjazz: this is referring to the function's context, I think. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OP	before 2.0, in order to usePromises in TS we would need to targed ES6 at tsconfig… if the target browser requires ES5, then we need to use babel to transpile again to ES5… so basically we had TS -> ES6 -> Babel -> ES5… so, did it changed with TS 2.0+ so we can usePromisein TS and target directlyh ES5?

IG	eliecerthoms: you would have to put some authentication middleware into your route to handle authentication, however this adds complexity to your application.

OP	Trying to get modules working properly in our app. Currently stuck at our collection of pipes, gathered in a PipeModule. If I import the module in multiple other modules that use the pipes I get an error sayingFooPipe is part of the declaration of 2 modules: PipeModule and PipeModule. If I only import it in our AppModule I get errors saying angular cant find the pipe. Am I missing something obvious here? o.O __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
CQ	urrang: did you export in PipeModule and only import in the other modules? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	still struggling to grasp the concepts to design a RNN networklet\'s say I wanted to detect motions/swipes on "touch pad" that consists of n x n sensors that record the state at a given interval. The users obviously do not make the motions identically, including the speeds might be different. So, now I have two questions:1) should I use a single n x n conv layer as input? or should I use some mega large input that contains all the n x n frames until the slowest motion is completed?2) if I used just single n x n as input, how should the training labeling be done? logically it seems that the label should be when the motion is completed, that is in the end, but should the other frames from the first to the last frame also be labeled the same? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	daredemo: You could use a CNN to obtain a single vector representation and then feed that into an RNN. Another approach I think of is to capture touchpad "activation" in a single matrix and let them decay with each timestep, so that most recent values will be 1 and old values will be close to zero and then apply a CNN to that single matrix. The problem with tihs approach is that you would need to detect start and end (maybe with another net?) __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	Paranaix: "You could use a CNN to obtain a single vector representation", could you elaborate on this? do you mean by this that would build input layer that is m frames deep? [m x n x n] if my frame is [n x n ]? because this seems a bad idea, as it would require a lot of computing each step. some kind of hidden Markov model would be preferred, when I would only need to know the previous state, not m previous states __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FQ	but if I use the [ n x n ] input, I\'m then struggling with the "2)": how do I label my data?when the finger touches the middle of the touch pad, it could then move anywhere, up down left right; so it would seem strange to label it as "up" even if it is part of "up" motion... or should I? or should those intermediate steps be all classified as "meh?" :D or some intermediate classifier like "doing up" and only the end would be "up"? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hey guys, I have one last question around spark's word2vec implementation (newest version). Is there anyway to update existing weights, like the standalone word2vec version? For example, if I start with a corpus of 1 gb, then add 500 more mbs at a later time, can it do so without overwriting the existing vocab and inMemoryLookupTable? If not, is there a way to merge two lookup tables? (I know you can add vocab cache, but I don't see anything for the inMemoryLookupTable). __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

How can i make connection with search button to trigger to load the result lists in result component ? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	@sayedrakib If your components are siblings then try to send event to the parent component to initialize the results to some variable say <srch_results> and using the bindings for the results component set one to get <srch_results>  and do what ever you want with that data in your results component.You can do it via services, Observables too.But if the results is a child component then you can do it directly thinking a bit will give you the sol.And for more on this read about component interacion cookbook on angular 2 website.https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/component-communication.html __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

CC	so if you have [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

CQ	and how would i know when to disconnect? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	when all subscribers unsubscribe then the dispose function will be executed as long as you “share” it.  I think share has been removed so you would need to run .publishReplay(1).refcount(). __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CQ	publishReplay? not regular 'publish'? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	I had to implement an operator that delayed the dispose though, because since changing routes will destroy the components before the new ones are created and the websocket connection will be torn down. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hi, I am willing to contribute to deeplearning4j-nlp-parent module, especially I am interested in allowing custom windows.Currently, DL4J implements sliding windows of given context size.

OP	I had trouble with the new version 0.8.7  it would not sync properly , it was syncing but was so slow it would never have cought up with it's self . I have now gone back to 0.8.6 .Could my problems have been due to the hard fork as that was the reason i updated to 0.8.7 ? Seeing as the Gethub site said the update was for those that use Mist and did not effect those that are just using the wallet as it does not access the internet. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I have read that others also had trouble syncing the new version 0.8.7 and that is the reason i stop trying with 0.8.7 and went back to 0.8.6 . I think it may follow the wrong Chain at block 1,346,??? not shore about that but the chain data started to bloat and get very big conpared to the size of the chain data that i currently have with 0.8.6 that was up to date as of about 36 hrs ago __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I also had trouble with 0.8.6 the first time . It would not sync . I then use Gerth and reved DB and then reloaded it the chain data with this command geth --fast --support-dao-fork --cache=512 --maxpeers 99 --jitvm and this worked __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

AC	Good night i will leave the wallet to sync as it does seem to be syncing but very slowly and the Chain data has grown by 1.3 gig for only aprox 3,200 blocks witch does not seem right , there is still 7,00 to go so i will check it in a few hours but i suspect that the patch does not work with 0.8.6 or does not do what you thought it would do __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	so i'll let it finish see how big the chain gets note it down and then redo the whole thing and see how big the chaindata folder is and let you know , if it is smaller then your patch is not working but i will let you know tomorrow so good night __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hi guys. I am trying to combine angular 2 with .net mvc 5 and I seem to lack some basic understanding here regarding npm. I have so far only used angular2 combined with meteor so I didn't have to deal with this things...Do I need to have node.js on the server for deployment? Like locally in development I just install my packages with npm install etc. in node_modules. But for deployment I don't want to have node.js there, can I just bundle node_modules somehow or how does it work? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	bergben: I would assume where you are deploying would have node installed - for example on Heroku you provide build instructions and your package.json file and it does the rest.  I believe digital ocean works the same way.  I have not done it in a while so I am recalling this from memory __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	bergben: you need node at build time, and you should be deploying an archived tarball to production __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	I understand I need it at build time, but I would rather build it beforehand and then deploy the build. By now I am thinking about bundling the whole node_modules using [<-LINK->] and then just include that file... Do you think that would work? Or how do you mean "deploying an archived tarball", how would I do that@ljharb?@maxwellsmart84I know how it works for Heorku, unfortunately this project is for a company for a client on a custom server and communicating them to install node.js and npm then do npm install etc. just makes it complicated for them and should be avoided at all costs __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FD	and it wont work with Xcode 8.2.1  because apple remove the old instrumentation that drives it, so it shouldn't work. So if you want to use appium 1.6.3, you have to roll back Mac OS to 10.11 and roll back to an older version of Xcode =  Xcode 8.0 pre.  and you wont be able to test on iOS 10 __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	Hi all, quick question on testing with typescript/nodejs. What's the best practice for testing a file (without testing its dependencies/mocking them) if I'm not using an IoC container for dependency injection? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	In the past I've used proxyquire/mockery to "hijack" node's require but I'm having a little difficulty getting that setup with typescript+ __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	ezra-quemuel: with jest (ts-jest) you can mock es6 modules __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	The trick/problem is that, when es6 modules imports are transpiled to commonjs require calls they are hoisted to the top of the file __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	babel-jest hoist your mock calls above the  require calls, but ts-jest doesn't support it yet.So what you can do is to put your jest.mock calls on a module and import first thing to your test file __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	ts-jest has other issues, like sometimes inaccurate coverage reports. but its working and super fast __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	anyway, i would advocate to inject all the dependencies and import only type information __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
