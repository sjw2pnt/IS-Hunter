IG	 [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	that's the easiest way to validate json against a defined interface __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	however, if your json is read and stored an ananythen you can't do anything, this type of type checking is only valid at compile time __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	hmm.. I see...setparam is defined asanyby angularfire lib, so I cant do anything right? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	if your use case is developer written objects, then it doesn't matter if your.setsignature uses ananyfor a parameter, as long as you validate it ahead of time. you could use a passthru function to do this: [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
UF	thanks! __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FQ	Hm.. when I retrieve my object from the server it adds a new field to it (.$key) so I cannot use my type (User) anymore. How can I handle this? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	use an interface instead of a class? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FD	if you get it from a server it's fine __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	I'm passing it via parameter __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	are you trying to access $key off of a variable of type User? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FD	ofabricio: if it's coming form the server, extra properties don't matter __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

PF	I see __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	Hmm.. but I need that key __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	then add it to the interface? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	should I create two interfaces? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	just add a$key?: ...to the interface __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	either that or cast it to <any> :) __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
NF	i cannot send a key to the server@dtabuenc __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	or use intersection type __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FD	or  you can dointerface User extends IServerObject {} __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	lots of weird stuff you can do :) __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
UF	right __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's up to you and what you are trying to do __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	if you cannot send$keyto the server, you'll have to run your object through a sanitize function to strip the unwanted bits, no way to automate that unfortunately __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AC	Hmm.. I think I'm going to create two interfaces then __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PF	that sounds like the most reasonable plan __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	not sure yet if I will ever send the objects i retrieve back to the server so this seems to fit better __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	and either use polymorphism or a type union to express the actual object __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	a type union is a third type? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hi All, I'm having trouble with Appium 1.6.3, Xcode 8.2.1, and iOS 10.2.  I installed the new iOS driver XCUITest and now I am trying to get my tests to run in an iPad Air 2 simulator - or really any iOS 10+ simulator.  The simulator pops up, the new WebDriverAgent appears to start, but my app WILL NOT launch.  It tries to, but closes immediately.  I've tried almost everything and sort of at a loss.  Will post more details momentarily about how I built the app and appium logs.  If anyone can help though I would appreciate it!! __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	I can launch the app in the simulator from within Xcode, which is strange.  So I am wondering if there is some conflict or incorrect setup of the new automation drivers... __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OP	Hi@all, I have a important question about the Interfacing in Typescript.Why does this example act like it does? Shouldn't test2,3 and 4 throw errors? [<-CODE->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	Z3roCoder: you should wrap your code in ``` __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so it's readable __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
UF	There we go :) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	interfaces aren't exclusive __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	they only require properties be there __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it doesn't care about extra properties __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	But in case 2 and 3, it requires exactly the properties in the interface __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	b is not in the interface, and this it complains that b shouldnt be there __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	return{a : 3 b:3}satisfies the interface __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	Look at my screenshot __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
NF	oh ... on object literals yeah __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	you need to do any on object literals if you want it to work __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So this is expected behaviour? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PF	yes __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's mostly designed for when you are passing object literals to function __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	When is, and when isn't, something a object literal in my example? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Isn't <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; also a object literal? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	yeah but then you are casting it specifically to an ITest __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So what's the difference then betweenreturn <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; andconst c: ITest = { a: 3, b: 3 } (This complains) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	what version are you using? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	2.1.4 __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	So the thinking is if you are setting extra properties you'll never be able to safely access them from the interface that you are assigning __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so the compiler assumes this is likely an error on your part __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	and you have to use type assertion to get around it __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	Why would this not apply to test4 then? This is basically the same example as test3, only that in this case, a Promise of the type ITest is returned __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	probably an edge case the compiler does not consider __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

AE	the harmony flag is for broken features - if it was reliable in production, it'd be unflagged. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
AE	Harmony is for not-quite-production-ready features, horribly broken features get their own separate flags. It does have a bunch of memory leaks and bugs though, so don't use itin production. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
AE	"production-ready" isn\'t a spectrum __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
AE	either way, the harmony flags are for testing v8. they're not meant for production use, and you're a bad person if you use them. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hello everyone ! Im also new to DL4J, tried some stuff, read about it and really like it :) . But what im currently struggling with is how to enable multi label data input in DL4J (an useful example would be tag prediction from an image) . For inputs with a single label i used the PathLabelGenerator, which was fine. Since Google and reading the docs did not help much (apart from redirecting to gitter :P ), i decided to ask here. __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

FD	Maybe have a threshold on minimum probability and take all the classes with at least that probability __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	But I take it you want to assign multiple labels to examples during training time. No idea how that would work honestly. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	the autoencoder example is quite simple... so I have still plenty of questions. first of all, there are many types of autoencoders such as Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder, Contractive autoencoder... which does DL4J support?do I need to do something special to make an autoencoder that is  Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder or Contractive autoencoder? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

FD	alex merged it few days ago __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	nice! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	daredemo: There are small special things for each of the subtypes of autoencoders.  Sparse has a penalty (usually L1) which encourages sparse activation in the inner-most hidden layer.  Denoising adds noise on the input and attempts to reconstruct a noise free output.  Variational autoencoders instead learn a mean and standard deviation instead of an explicit internal state, then randomly generate a hidden state from those values and reconstruct. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	Of the bunch, denoising is perhaps the easiest to train, since you just had to do train(myExamples + noise, myExamples) __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

CQ	never heard of harness, what is that? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	TypeScript uses it to test compilation output for different use-cases to prevent regressions. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	domoritz: My guess forts.TypeFlags.Anonymous that now only ts.ObjectFlags.Anonymous is possible, but I'm only guessing __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	ts.NodeFlags.Abstract seems to be only available asts.ModifierFlags.Abstract __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
AE	Since I have no Idea what your ts to json compiler does it is hard to help you out :) __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	tuple is also now in object __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	and reference also __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	just a reminder@domoritz add more documentation to your lib code ;) __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	con-ssc: : json-schema does... schemas for json. his lib would allow reusing TS's compile-time sanity checks during run-time (i.e. on JSON data coming in over the wire), __eou__	user	1	1	0	1
PF	which is pretty cool. :) __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
