OQ	how are npm modules going to work when there are many different yearly versions of javascript? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	protometa: there is theenginesproperty ( [<-LINK->] ) to warn about compatibility __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	ewnd9: engines could work  __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AE	but it doesn't seem to be used much. I'm also thinking about the use of npm for frontend modules. It seems like we are going to need to have better tracking of javascript version or we'll be in javascript version hell, or be stuck with publishing only es5 modules forever. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AE	protometa: I'm fine with es5 . But as an example of a variation - somereact-nativemodules are published as is and if you need to use them in other environments you need to use only single presetbabel-preset-react-native __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
AE	ewnd9: that works if you know a specific module or set of modules is pure es6 or es7 but seems like we need a more general solution for module consumers to know which version of javascript a module uses. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AE	rather than making it a concern of newer modules to covert for older consumers the older consumers could just convert newer modules that they wish to use. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hi guys. I am trying to combine angular 2 with .net mvc 5 and I seem to lack some basic understanding here regarding npm. I have so far only used angular2 combined with meteor so I didn't have to deal with this things...Do I need to have node.js on the server for deployment? Like locally in development I just install my packages with npm install etc. in node_modules. But for deployment I don't want to have node.js there, can I just bundle node_modules somehow or how does it work? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	bergben: I would assume where you are deploying would have node installed - for example on Heroku you provide build instructions and your package.json file and it does the rest.  I believe digital ocean works the same way.  I have not done it in a while so I am recalling this from memory __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	bergben: you need node at build time, and you should be deploying an archived tarball to production __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	I understand I need it at build time, but I would rather build it beforehand and then deploy the build. By now I am thinking about bundling the whole node_modules using [<-LINK->] and then just include that file... Do you think that would work? Or how do you mean "deploying an archived tarball", how would I do that@ljharb?@maxwellsmart84I know how it works for Heorku, unfortunately this project is for a company for a client on a custom server and communicating them to install node.js and npm then do npm install etc. just makes it complicated for them and should be avoided at all costs __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hi all, I've just re-written the history of the project I'm working on to purge all remnants of  previously checked in node modules. I've also chosen to use yarn with an offline cache. The only snag is node-sass, which requires a binding. It's not a problem locally, where I have internet access, but the build server is not online, and is therefore not able to download the binding. Does anybody know if it's possible to cache vendor bindings somehow? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
