OQ	Hello,I got Caddyserver running. The Database is working correctly now and moved the domain to point to my new server. Somehow I get just a clear Website, even when I curl the webseite I get zero response.I have made a look into the Caddyserver logs and WordPress logs and I get the request, but no response. I also installed nginx as a container and served the nginx to Caddy to see if Caddy is proxying correctly. I get the welcome screen from nginx. So this is working fine, but when I again bind the WordPress container to Caddy its just nothing.Do you have a clue what can be the reason to get no response on the client but requests on the server?Thank you! __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	the autoencoder example is quite simple... so I have still plenty of questions. first of all, there are many types of autoencoders such as Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder, Contractive autoencoder... which does DL4J support?do I need to do something special to make an autoencoder that is  Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder or Contractive autoencoder? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	variational autoencoder now available at current master __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	alex merged it few days ago __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	nice! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	daredemo: There are small special things for each of the subtypes of autoencoders.  Sparse has a penalty (usually L1) which encourages sparse activation in the inner-most hidden layer.  Denoising adds noise on the input and attempts to reconstruct a noise free output.  Variational autoencoders instead learn a mean and standard deviation instead of an explicit internal state, then randomly generate a hidden state from those values and reconstruct. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

IG	 [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	that's the easiest way to validate json against a defined interface __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

UF	right __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's up to you and what you are trying to do __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

OQ	hi! does anyone happen to know about inspecting execution state in a container? when you execa command you can see the exec id in the container state, and the docker API allows you to query that state (e.g. to see whether it’s running) but I don’t see any docs for command line support __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

CQ	mikewrighton: you mean this? [<-LINK->] __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hi All, I'm having trouble with Appium 1.6.3, Xcode 8.2.1, and iOS 10.2.  I installed the new iOS driver XCUITest and now I am trying to get my tests to run in an iPad Air 2 simulator - or really any iOS 10+ simulator.  The simulator pops up, the new WebDriverAgent appears to start, but my app WILL NOT launch.  It tries to, but closes immediately.  I've tried almost everything and sort of at a loss.  Will post more details momentarily about how I built the app and appium logs.  If anyone can help though I would appreciate it!! __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

IG	K8s and Rancher has healthchecks for their "services" and swarm simply checks that all containers have a healthy state. And as long as every container has a healty state all containers work as expected and everything from outside is L4 mesh magic :D __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

FQ	There are 2 types of health check. Local, where if unhealthy, just suicide(the HEALTHCHECK is a good candidate for that) and the distributed consensus, which is made by external sources trying to reach that container and failing, so they agree on ask docker to kill it __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

Are there more comprehensive resources than the official TS doc to learn about how to write declaration files? I don't want to come asking for help here overtime I use a new JS library in my project. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	that just describes a constructor __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	so if you have a variable: __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-CODE->] the new in that interface is what allows you to do [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	if the new wasn't in the interface then that would not compile __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
AE	Think of interfaces as a description of what you can do with the object they describe. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-CODE->] Just declares that there is a global constant calledCalHeatMapand the things you can do with it are describe by the interfaceCalHeatMapStatic __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	which means that the thing you can do with that constant is call new CalHeatMap() and you will get back an object which you can do the things described in the CalHeatMapinterface. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OP	dtabuenc: do you have an idea for  [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
CQ	yeah you trying to do a discriminated union? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
IG	they type of type has to be a literal type __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	right now it's just a string __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	they also probably shouldn't be classes. use interface whenever possible for developing these apis __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	you can make classes to construct them if you want __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
NF	dtabuenc: still not working.  __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	does this mean I have to create a type'A'? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
PF	that should work for certain __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	paste your full real code __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
PF	ok sorry this is indeed working __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FQ	but this was a minimal __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	now what if I use a var [<-CODE->]  __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	no change, it will still infer the type of A_TYPE is string __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	and won't narrow it to the literal string 'A' __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CC	but I can't doreadonly type: A_TYPE = A_TYPE __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
PF	yea because that wouldn't make any sense __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	A_TYPE is a value not a type __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	it's an alias/name for a value in your program __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	when the code sees a string literal, it assumes unless given other context that it must be of type string __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
AE	I actually have a ticket open about a use-case where I think this is not-awesome __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-ISSUE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	I don't understand what this is doing [<-CODE->] because if I do [<-CODE->] this works __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	but the type function is not creating any type __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FQ	T is string ? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CQ	where are you gettiug this code from? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	that doesn't look like something you would write accidently __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
NF	absolutely not lol __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	I'm trying to understand __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
UF	gotcha __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

FD	 [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
OQ	can I somehow inject Math object to use inside my template? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	 [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	DzmitryShylovich: I got it to work as you explained, thank you! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	PhotoPaul: creating a pipe is more elegant __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	n00dl3: You are right __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AE	but this is already part of a 3 piece pipe so I thought of keeping it simple __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AC	Maybe if I need to use it again I will convert it into a pipe __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
