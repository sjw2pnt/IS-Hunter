OQ	Hi guys. I am trying to combine angular 2 with .net mvc 5 and I seem to lack some basic understanding here regarding npm. I have so far only used angular2 combined with meteor so I didn't have to deal with this things...Do I need to have node.js on the server for deployment? Like locally in development I just install my packages with npm install etc. in node_modules. But for deployment I don't want to have node.js there, can I just bundle node_modules somehow or how does it work? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	bergben: I would assume where you are deploying would have node installed - for example on Heroku you provide build instructions and your package.json file and it does the rest.  I believe digital ocean works the same way.  I have not done it in a while so I am recalling this from memory __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	bergben: you need node at build time, and you should be deploying an archived tarball to production __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	I understand I need it at build time, but I would rather build it beforehand and then deploy the build. By now I am thinking about bundling the whole node_modules using [<-LINK->] and then just include that file... Do you think that would work? Or how do you mean "deploying an archived tarball", how would I do that@ljharb?@maxwellsmart84I know how it works for Heorku, unfortunately this project is for a company for a client on a custom server and communicating them to install node.js and npm then do npm install etc. just makes it complicated for them and should be avoided at all costs __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

CQ	bergben: are you deploying to a UNIX env? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CC	Actually I am not even the one deploying so I don't even know that, I just know it should be as easy as possible and therefore the frontend stuff should just be bundled and included and good to go. No prior extra work on the server needed, so it shouldn't even matter which server I deploy to... __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AE	yeah that is tricky __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
IG	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	i found that - so its possible to run package manager through a proxy - just not sure if its your solution __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	I actually got it runnng using rollupjs. It gets an entry point and follows up all the import statements and creates a minified bundle out of that. This is freaking awesome. All I have to do in production now is include one single javascript file __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
PF	maxwellsmart84: Thanks though, I appreciate your effort! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	bergben: you're definitely supposed to build, tar up the build, and then deploy that archive later __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	also I don't understand how distributing images works.

FD	is that correct? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	well the scary part was the hacks I saw to get specific layers not to cache __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	which I undrestand busts everything after __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	siassaj: you are correct, if you are building on top of the same base layer for a specific image "repository" then it will already have that base layer if you have previous pushed an image to it, then it only has to transfer the newer/different layers __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

CC	Z3roCoder: you should wrap your code in ``` __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so it's readable __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
UF	There we go :) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	interfaces aren't exclusive __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	they only require properties be there __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it doesn't care about extra properties __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	But in case 2 and 3, it requires exactly the properties in the interface __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	b is not in the interface, and this it complains that b shouldnt be there __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	return{a : 3 b:3}satisfies the interface __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	Look at my screenshot __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
NF	oh ... on object literals yeah __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	you need to do any on object literals if you want it to work __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So this is expected behaviour? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PF	yes __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's mostly designed for when you are passing object literals to function __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	When is, and when isn't, something a object literal in my example? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Isn't <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; also a object literal? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	yeah but then you are casting it specifically to an ITest __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So what's the difference then betweenreturn <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; andconst c: ITest = { a: 3, b: 3 } (This complains) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	what version are you using? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	2.1.4 __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	So the thinking is if you are setting extra properties you'll never be able to safely access them from the interface that you are assigning __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so the compiler assumes this is likely an error on your part __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	and you have to use type assertion to get around it __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	Why would this not apply to test4 then? This is basically the same example as test3, only that in this case, a Promise of the type ITest is returned __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	probably an edge case the compiler does not consider __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

OQ	Is it a bug or a feature that it looks to people that I read at Gitter messages immediately because I use irc.gitter.im? This came to my attention at [<-LINK->] __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

IG	"feature" I think, as you also get to read people's messages instantly and when they make edits it sends a new message to your client rather than "fixing" the old one, so you can see everybody's dirty minds :D __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	Hey, easiest way to transform a string into a JSON? The string is already in a valid json format, only a bracket at the beginning and at the ending (was originally an array of json objects). Anyone has an idea? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	AlexDBlack: is there a way to calculate how much time it would take for Word2Vec to fit on some data? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	or even monitor what's going on? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	The reason why I am asking is because it has been more than 1 hour 20 minutes since the last log entry of  "Starting vocabulary building..." and 1 hour since it finished iterating over the data. PS: There were 58754 sentences for training the model __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	KonceptGeek: with a small data set like that, it shouldn't take longyou can add a VectorsListener instance to track progress... it should also log plenty of infobtw,  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

IG	KonceptGeek: I'd suggest asking @raver119 about the word2vec performance issues (he should be online in about 6 hours maybe?)fwiw it should be significantly faster than 0.6.0, and your data isn't largefeel free to open an issue though with details and configuration - that might make things easier for us __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
AE	Sure@AlexDBlack. BTW, each sentence is a pretty big (almost a complete email/document) so that could possibly be slowing things down. And it's running on an 8core CPU. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

GG	Hello guys :D __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
OP	I need some help from any admin!. I had created this account : [<-LINK->] , which was associated with the github account severustux. But later I deleted the linked github account and opened the account  "severus-tux" and this is the one I am currently using ( [<-LINK->] ) . I would like to delete my old gitter account  ( [<-LINK->] ) but I cannot login to it as I have completely deleted the linked github account. Could someone help me ? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Suppose I got two modules and one app entry point where all modules are loaded. How to check from module 2 that module 1 is loaded on the entry point or not __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	Module are loaded as soon as you require them and usually you want to do that once at the top of your app entry point __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	is it somehow possible to reverse engineer the filename from an instance in a DataSetIterator? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	Could someone tell me:  I have created a utility class with  export class Utility {  formatDate() { } }     And to use it in a component, I create a variable of that class ie: util = new Utility();  and the to use the formatDate() function I just call util.formatDate();   My question is this, in C# if  you create a 'static' class with a public static function, you don't have to instantiate the class with new.  Can you do that with typescript ?  What I'm wondering is if I can just do Utility.formatDate() __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	yes you can do that __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	if the class has a static function you don't need to invoke it with new __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
