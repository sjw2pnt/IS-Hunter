OP	Is Appium 1.6.3 supposed to be able to run multiple Android emulators concurrently assuming I use separate Appium server instances? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Whenever I try to do it, Appium just cannot seem to handle it. For example, one server instance is supposed to handle one emulator but then it telnets into the other emulator or something. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Maybe that's not even it, but it tries to do something with both emulators. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

IG	in ruby __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	Hmm. Not sure what that appium_lib is so I will check that out. Maybe I could just put the UDID inside my "default-capabilities.json" file? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

FD	If it's Appium then maybe it will work. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	server has to know exact UDID to talk to and your driver  has to know what UDID and appium port to talk to __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FQ	I launched one emulator (Android 5.1) andadb devicesgave me "emulator-5554". Then I quit the emulator and launched another one (Android 7.1). This time,adb devicesalso gave me "emulator-5554". __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	If I then start up the first emulator again (Android 5.1), its UDID appears to be "emulator-5556". __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I don't know but maybe this is a problem for Appium? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	I have an idea. I can try to use the avdArgs capability to pass the "-port" parameter to the emulator. "Set the console port number for this emulator instance to <port>. The console port number must be an even integer between 5554 and 5584, inclusive. <port>+1 must also be free and will be reserved for adb." __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hi All, I'm having trouble with Appium 1.6.3, Xcode 8.2.1, and iOS 10.2.  I installed the new iOS driver XCUITest and now I am trying to get my tests to run in an iPad Air 2 simulator - or really any iOS 10+ simulator.  The simulator pops up, the new WebDriverAgent appears to start, but my app WILL NOT launch.  It tries to, but closes immediately.  I've tried almost everything and sort of at a loss.  Will post more details momentarily about how I built the app and appium logs.  If anyone can help though I would appreciate it!! __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
