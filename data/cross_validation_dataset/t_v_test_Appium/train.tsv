OQ	 [<-CODE->] Hi @dtabuenc. Thanks a lot! This does work but for me it's still black magic. Are there more comprehensive resources than the official TS doc to learn about how to write declaration files? I don't want to come asking for help here overtime I use a new JS library in my project. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	that just describes a constructor __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	so if you have a variable: __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-CODE->] the new in that interface is what allows you to do [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	if the new wasn't in the interface then that would not compile __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
AE	Think of interfaces as a description of what you can do with the object they describe. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-CODE->] Just declares that there is a global constant calledCalHeatMapand the things you can do with it are describe by the interfaceCalHeatMapStatic __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	which means that the thing you can do with that constant is call new CalHeatMap() and you will get back an object which you can do the things described in the CalHeatMapinterface. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OP	dtabuenc: do you have an idea for  [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
CQ	yeah you trying to do a discriminated union? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
IG	they type of type has to be a literal type __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	right now it's just a string __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	they also probably shouldn't be classes. use interface whenever possible for developing these apis __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	you can make classes to construct them if you want __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
NF	dtabuenc: still not working.  __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FQ	but this was a minimal __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	now what if I use a var [<-CODE->]  __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	no change, it will still infer the type of A_TYPE is string __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	and won't narrow it to the literal string 'A' __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CC	but I can't doreadonly type: A_TYPE = A_TYPE __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
PF	yea because that wouldn't make any sense __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	A_TYPE is a value not a type __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	it's an alias/name for a value in your program __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hi guys, I have a simple question.  We can define some attribute in class likename?: stringwhich means that it may or may not be present. So is there any compiler flag or anything in typescript which will force me to do a type check before using it. For example handle the null case and to handle the case when name is a string? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	rajdeep26: Sortof. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	the closest would be turning on strict null checks __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	it won't catch every use, only mis-uses. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
CC	that will not force me to do a type check or empty check before using right? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	the type for an optional property likename?: stringwould bestring | undefined __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	so for example if you try to do [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	that would fail __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	sincestring | undefined is not assignable tostring __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OP	I had trouble with the new version 0.8.7  it would not sync properly , it was syncing but was so slow it would never have cought up with it's self . I have now gone back to 0.8.6 .Could my problems have been due to the hard fork as that was the reason i updated to 0.8.7 ?

OP	Trying to get modules working properly in our app. Currently stuck at our collection of pipes, gathered in a PipeModule.

IG	@sayedrakib If your components are siblings then try to send event to the parent component to initialize the results to some variable say <srch_results> and using the bindings for the results component set one to get <srch_results>  and do what ever you want with that data in your results component.You can do it via services, Observables too.But if the results is a child component then you can do it directly thinking a bit will give you the sol.And for more on this read about component interacion cookbook on angular 2 website.https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/component-communication.html __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	Reactive forms Question:  What's the best way to handle conditional validation?  Say you have two radio buttons, and selecting one displays a subform with required fields.  If the other radio button is selected, then the form's validity should not consider the (hidden) subform's validity.  So far I've considered: [<-CODE->] Both of these are ugly, but #1 seems like a better approach to me.  Anyone else deal with this? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hi guys,Just wanted to ask a few questions regarding to Blockchain:First Question:Do blockchain only accepts digital currencies? Or do they also accept transaction of normal currencies like USD and so on. Will it involve any banks in the process to join the blockchain?Second Question:Does that mean blockchain is eliminating any third party or servicing company like Amazon, Alibaba and more that takes a share in the process?Hope to hear from you all soon thanks! =) __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	I think, I have something important to say.It's the second time that this happens with me. I install docker on Linux Mint and after some hours the disk is full. Dont know why this happens, but I found out one thing, that also happens these two times. I lost all my system backups (I use timeshift). I dont know if it's some kind of conflit, but I think I have to report this, because it's a shame. The last time I had to reinstall my system, because I couldnt even start the system. This time, when I realise I had just 6GB left, I deleted some stuff here to have at least 20GB free, then disconnect from internet, restart, delete all docker images (Yes, I installed yesterday and I downloaded 4 images) then uninstall docker, and the magic happens. 100GB free right now ... Someone tells me. How this is even possibel that docker uses 100GB ? I was watching the free space decreasing. C'mon. Fix that. Until there, I will be using docker on a virtual machine, because I cant trust this software anymore. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	hey guys, so I am wondering how you all manage your docker compose definitions, say I have an api, built in a microservice architecture, it results in something like 50+ docker compose services and I am wondering, if there is a better way to setup all these services using tools instead of hardcoded yml files on disk __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	I guess a nicer way would be through some interface, where I can build the configurations and house them in a tool which I could run, store them in a backend database, then I could manage them easier, any tools which you guys run that would help? or do you run everything using docker run? I guess not, cause multi service architectures would be a bit tricky to manage __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	If I've got a docker container running docker (teamcity agent running builds) what is the best way to mount a volume in the 'parent' container into the 'child' container? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	The 'parent' container has the host docker socket bound (-v /var/run/docker.sock:) so when the agent (parent container) tries to run a new container and pass some -v flags; the -v flags don't get mounted correctly as far as I can tell __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	presumably because it's not actually a child; but a sibling; and the directory trying to be mounted doesn't actually exist outside the 'parent' __eou__	user	1	1	0	1
IG	Trezamere: I haven\'t actually messed with volumes in that manner, but have you tried using "volumes_from" by creating a sibling of the parent container that maps in the volumes from the host you want to use and then having the spun up agents using  volumes_from? __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	Hi all, quick question on testing with typescript/nodejs. What's the best practice for testing a file (without testing its dependencies/mocking them) if I'm not using an IoC container for dependency injection? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	In the past I've used proxyquire/mockery to "hijack" node's require but I'm having a little difficulty getting that setup with typescript+ __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	ezra-quemuel: with jest (ts-jest) you can mock es6 modules __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	The trick/problem is that, when es6 modules imports are transpiled to commonjs require calls they are hoisted to the top of the file __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	babel-jest hoist your mock calls above the  require calls, but ts-jest doesn't support it yet.So what you can do is to put your jest.mock calls on a module and import first thing to your test file __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	ts-jest has other issues, like sometimes inaccurate coverage reports. but its working and super fast __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	Guys help please. I don't understand what each gate in LSTM architecture produce. Is it a number or a vector? If I'm not wrong  sigmoid function ALWAYS produces only one number in range from 0 to 1. Or it is possible that every gate produces target vector that was obtained by applying sigmoid function to each element of  input vector? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	each gate produces a single number in range 0 to 1. you have 4 gates per LSTM unit, and multiple units per LSTM layer __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
CQ	Is number of units == LSTM.nOut(numberUnits) of layer actually? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

CC	fahman: yes __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CC	by LSTM block I mean LSTM unit __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	i would like to dockerize a project that consist of:a frontend codebase (angular 2, after npm run build all the STATIC files i need is in the dist directory)\na backend codebase (a nodejs app w/o any transpilation build process)the production nginx.conf file looks like this: [<-CODE->] the backend api got a dependency for mongodb, so i will need a node, mongo, nginx Dockerfile __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	what i am not sure is,  to which image's filesystem should i put the frontend static files? It should be in the nginx image. Am i correct? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

CC	you mean they check themselves, not the containers __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	K8s and Rancher has healthchecks for their "services" and swarm simply checks that all containers have a healthy state. And as long as every container has a healty state all containers work as expected and everything from outside is L4 mesh magic :D __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
AE	i think he's saying they check the container's health status based on the result of that HEALTHCHECK entry as likely listed bydocker inspect, and have an option to auto-kill the container should it be unhealthy __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FQ	There are 2 types of health check. Local, where if unhealthy, just suicide(the HEALTHCHECK is a good candidate for that) and the distributed consensus, which is made by external sources trying to reach that container and failing, so they agree on ask docker to kill it __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FD	So one other question, regarding npm publishing.If you include a .d.ts with a JS npm library, how would you handle fixes to types only? i.e., if the package version doesn't increment, I guess no one will get the updated types.But if the library has primarily JS users, they might not want the versioning noise of typescript definition fixes and the maintainers might not want to bump versions for just that. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	So I'm trying to figure out a way to build images that arecompletedbuilds for my rails app deployments. I've basically read a bunch of stuff and come to the conclusion that I should create an image that has all my base dependencies like ruby version, nodejs, etc. Then i should create a dockerfile using that image as base, then copying over my 'tmp' directory that contains build cache, my 'node_modules' dir that contains previously downloaded javascript dependencies, and similarly so for my gems, and my javascript and image/css precompiled assets. After copying them into the image i can run my ruby 'build' tasks, then save all the new tmp, node_modules etc contents back to the host computer filesystem, and finish off the dockerfile. __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	If i'm not mistake this can give me very fast build times with minimal downloading etc and leads to a single image that I can spin up on any number of machines very quickly __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	does this approach make any sense? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	apologies for the lack of sensible terminology. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	if you want to leverage caching of build tasks, yes, that's the best solution. But to release a container for production, I usually remove build tools and ship the container with the minimum to run the service. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CC	I dont understand shipping containers __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	i thought you ship images, and when you run them you end up with a container on the host system __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	are you saying i should build everything first, then copy what i need into a docker image? __eou__	user	1	1	0	1

OQ	So when I run a docker instance, my entrypoint runs some bootstrapping commands to sync dependancies (specifically php'scomposer install).

FD	Looks like docker-composer supports auserkey in the yaml file. I'll try it out, but it would be nice if there was an agnostic way to let all developers run the same config. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	sbbowers__twitter: typically this is construct you create inside your container that picks up the user running the container's ID and chown all the files inside the container to that user during the build __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	dragon788: So the "standard approach" is to bake in "gosu" into all of your docker images by curling a binary off the net and then require your entrypoint to run the command through that, which gives you the option of passing an environment variable with the ID of your current user, all of which won\'t work with docker-compose. Do I understand that right? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	I think gosu is one way to do it, but really since it isn't recommended to run as root anyways, a lot of containers will chmod everything to a known user and run everything as that, the trick is whether that UID exists on your system or not __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FQ	So the easy way would to do auseradd -u {some arbitrary ID I pick} docker-useron the host and then pass that user ID to docker's -u? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OP	is there a way to docker monitor if a service inside the container is alive or not? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I mean, the main ENTRYPOINT is alive, so from docker perspective, the container is running however, some internal crap happen on the app and I need docker to check with some sort of heartbeat the application (idk, a ping on a specific port or whatever) and if it does'nt reply, just kill the container... is it possible? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	need some health monitoring internal and external to the container; something internal to keep checking the status of what you need running/accessible, and something external to poll it once in a while to know to kill/restart it.... there's unfortunately so many ways to accomplish this, it just depends on what level of effort you want to put into it. __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FD	in Orleans we have a health monitoring service which all nodes of the cluster ping each other and after a given number of ping fail from some servers, they declare it dead, and remove from the cluster membership ring __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	it already works pretty fine on VMs and bare metal __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I did implemented an Docker membership provider __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem now is that for the provider, it only knows if a node is up or down only by checking docker daemon if it is up or down __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	and that is our problem __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FQ	a container can be app, but some internal thread in the application process for whatever reason is blocked __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so no new requests should go to that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so the idea is to ask docker (or swarm) to kill that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	but to be sure of that, I need to detect this stallness correctly __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

FD	each node of Orleans cluster (which is a container) send health messages to each other __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the rendevour point of those messages, used to be the membership table __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	if multiple nodes try to reach a node and fail (lets say 3 times), that node is marked as dead __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	even if the machine is running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so noone will send a message to it again __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	now, in docker, we don't have that table __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	we were relying on docker labels __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so each Orleans node should query docker (or swarm) daemon periodically about all the containers with a given Label that are running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	that would make them know who is on the cluster __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	if a container is killed/exit, next query on docker api will return all containers - that one __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	that is ok for periodic refreshes and consider only the container up or down __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is internal __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I need to mark a container as dead even if it is running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	could you then iterate over all the containers and exec a "health check" script that is consistently implemented? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CQ	even if it does NOTHING? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	the problem is not the healthcheck mecanism __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	we already have it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is how to mark it as dead __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	errr, other than just killing the container? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CQ	or can you modify a label? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	ok way, let me rephrase __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	i haven't messed with labels really outside of RancherOs __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is how to save the counted votes to kill that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	so my knowledge there is low as well, other than you can kinda query against them __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	remember, before docker, we had that table as a central point __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	now I have labels __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	still struggling to grasp the concepts to design a RNN networklet\'s say I wanted to detect motions/swipes on "touch pad" that consists of n x n sensors that record the state at a given interval. The users obviously do not make the motions identically, including the speeds might be different. So, now I have two questions:1) should I use a single n x n conv layer as input? or should I use some mega large input that contains all the n x n frames until the slowest motion is completed?2) if I used just single n x n as input, how should the training labeling be done? logically it seems that the label should be when the motion is completed, that is in the end, but should the other frames from the first to the last frame also be labeled the same? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	daredemo: You could use a CNN to obtain a single vector representation and then feed that into an RNN. Another approach I think of is to capture touchpad "activation" in a single matrix and let them decay with each timestep, so that most recent values will be 1 and old values will be close to zero and then apply a CNN to that single matrix. The problem with tihs approach is that you would need to detect start and end (maybe with another net?) __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	Paranaix: "You could use a CNN to obtain a single vector representation", could you elaborate on this? do you mean by this that would build input layer that is m frames deep? [m x n x n] if my frame is [n x n ]? because this seems a bad idea, as it would require a lot of computing each step. some kind of hidden Markov model would be preferred, when I would only need to know the previous state, not m previous states __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FQ	but if I use the [ n x n ] input, I\'m then struggling with the "2)": how do I label my data?when the finger touches the middle of the touch pad, it could then move anywhere, up down left right; so it would seem strange to label it as "up" even if it is part of "up" motion... or should I? or should those intermediate steps be all classified as "meh?" :D or some intermediate classifier like "doing up" and only the end would be "up"? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

IG	I think the base href should really be just / __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	./ __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	fplini: try<script>document.write(\'<base href="\' + document.location + \'" />\');</script> __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
PF	DzmitryShylovich: yes with this script it works fine. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
NF	but when I refresh I received a "not found" error __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	path/hash location strategy? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	Uhm.. If I add the hash the refresh is ok but ng2 doesn't recognize the route and redirects on  home but the url is broken.. let me explain better with an example __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	fplini: add this to your appmodules providers [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AE	my url is [<-LINK->] if I refresh the page I get a not found error. Instead if i go on [<-LINK->] the app goes on the home and the new url is [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	SamiAl90: I'm going to try with this code ;) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	fplini: what location strategy do u use? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	default one? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	yes default __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	(without hash) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	fplini: u need to configure your server to return index.html for all angular routes __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AE	I'm only set the context root path in the jboss-web.xml to make available the app under the right path __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
JK	I'm serious __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	fplini:  [<-LINK->]  __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AC	DzmitryShylovich: thanks I'm going to check it and try a lot. I'll come back later :) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	hey.. i got my caddyserver working.. i get a database error now from wordpress container __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

FD	Error establishing a database connection __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
OQ	Hello,I got Caddyserver running. The Database is working correctly now and moved the domain to point to my new server. Somehow I get just a clear Website, even when I curl the webseite I get zero response.I have made a look into the Caddyserver logs and WordPress logs and I get the request, but no response. I also installed nginx as a container and served the nginx to Caddy to see if Caddy is proxying correctly. I get the welcome screen from nginx. So this is working fine, but when I again bind the WordPress container to Caddy its just nothing.Do you have a clue what can be the reason to get no response on the client but requests on the server?Thank you! __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
