IG	eliecerthoms: you would have to put some authentication middleware into your route to handle authentication, however this adds complexity to your application.

OQ	Hi guys, I have a simple question.  We can define some attribute in class likename?: stringwhich means that it may or may not be present. So is there any compiler flag or anything in typescript which will force me to do a type check before using it. For example handle the null case and to handle the case when name is a string? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	rajdeep26: Sortof. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	the closest would be turning on strict null checks __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	it won't catch every use, only mis-uses. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
CC	that will not force me to do a type check or empty check before using right? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	the type for an optional property likename?: stringwould bestring | undefined __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	so for example if you try to do [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	that would fail __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	sincestring | undefined is not assignable tostring __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Also it would  prevent you from doing object WithOptionalName.name.length __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	without first doing a check for object WithOptionalName.name !== undefined __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
UF	Thanks@dtabuenc __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FD	harder sometimes to get an existing project up to a state where you can turn that on though __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	that's why it's not the default __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	ya, we just started with a new project a week back __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FD	no Implicit. Any no Implicit Returns no Implicit This strict Null Checks no Unused Locals no Unused Parameters no Fall through Cases In Switch __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	also I don't understand how distributing images works.

IG	siassaj: you are correct, if you are building on top of the same base layer for a specific image "repository" then it will already have that base layer if you have previous pushed an image to it, then it only has to transfer the newer/different layers __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

FD	so each Orleans node should query docker (or swarm) daemon periodically about all the containers with a given Label that are running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OP	before 2.0, in order to usePromises in TS we would need to targed ES6 at tsconfig… if the target browser requires ES5, then we need to use babel to transpile again to ES5… so basically we had TS -> ES6 -> Babel -> ES5… so, did it changed with TS 2.0+ so we can usePromisein TS and target directlyh ES5?

OQ	So when I run a docker instance, my entrypoint runs some bootstrapping commands to sync dependancies (specifically php'scomposer install).  These dependencies are written to disk owned by root:root. Is there a way to tell docker (specifically docker-compose) to write files as the user I'm running docker as? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	Looks like docker-composer supports auserkey in the yaml file. I'll try it out, but it would be nice if there was an agnostic way to let all developers run the same config. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	sbbowers__twitter: typically this is construct you create inside your container that picks up the user running the container's ID and chown all the files inside the container to that user during the build __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	dragon788: So the "standard approach" is to bake in "gosu" into all of your docker images by curling a binary off the net and then require your entrypoint to run the command through that, which gives you the option of passing an environment variable with the ID of your current user, all of which won\'t work with docker-compose. Do I understand that right? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	I think gosu is one way to do it, but really since it isn't recommended to run as root anyways, a lot of containers will chmod everything to a known user and run everything as that, the trick is whether that UID exists on your system or not __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FQ	So the easy way would to do auseradd -u {some arbitrary ID I pick} docker-useron the host and then pass that user ID to docker's -u? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	If I specify "docker-user" to docker, will it resolve the ID from the host, or does it do a useradd and create a new user? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

CC	do you wnat the correct syntax for calling it? or for defining it's type? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	for calling it. Because it seems like it does not get executed (don't get the "response" in the other end) __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

CC	I don't follow? :) It's binded to a Function? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	so if you have [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	Yes __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	then at it's simplest you just call it: [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	Sure __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	but it expects a parameter in the other end :) __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	that's the "value"-part __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	what does onSomethingChanged look like? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	the autoencoder example is quite simple... so I have still plenty of questions. first of all, there are many types of autoencoders such as Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder, Contractive autoencoder... which does DL4J support?do I need to do something special to make an autoencoder that is  Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder or Contractive autoencoder? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	variational autoencoder now available at current master __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	alex merged it few days ago __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	nice! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	daredemo: There are small special things for each of the subtypes of autoencoders.  Sparse has a penalty (usually L1) which encourages sparse activation in the inner-most hidden layer.  Denoising adds noise on the input and attempts to reconstruct a noise free output.  Variational autoencoders instead learn a mean and standard deviation instead of an explicit internal state, then randomly generate a hidden state from those values and reconstruct. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	Of the bunch, denoising is perhaps the easiest to train, since you just had to do train(myExamples + noise, myExamples) __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hi all, I've just re-written the history of the project I'm working on to purge all remnants of  previously checked in node modules. I've also chosen to use yarn with an offline cache. The only snag is node-sass, which requires a binding. It's not a problem locally, where I have internet access, but the build server is not online, and is therefore not able to download the binding. Does anybody know if it's possible to cache vendor bindings somehow? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Guys help please. I don't understand what each gate in LSTM architecture produce. Is it a number or a vector?

OP	I had trouble with the new version 0.8.7  it would not sync properly , it was syncing but was so slow it would never have cought up with it's self . I have now gone back to 0.8.6 .Could my problems have been due to the hard fork as that was the reason i updated to 0.8.7 ? Seeing as the Gethub site said the update was for those that use Mist and did not effect those that are just using the wallet as it does not access the internet. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I have read that others also had trouble syncing the new version 0.8.7 and that is the reason i stop trying with 0.8.7 and went back to 0.8.6 . I think it may follow the wrong Chain at block 1,346,??? not shore about that but the chain data started to bloat and get very big conpared to the size of the chain data that i currently have with 0.8.6 that was up to date as of about 36 hrs ago __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

AC	Good night i will leave the wallet to sync as it does seem to be syncing but very slowly and the Chain data has grown by 1.3 gig for only aprox 3,200 blocks witch does not seem right , there is still 7,00 to go so i will check it in a few hours but i suspect that the patch does not work with 0.8.6 or does not do what you thought it would do __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	so i'll let it finish see how big the chain gets note it down and then redo the whole thing and see how big the chaindata folder is and let you know , if it is smaller then your patch is not working but i will let you know tomorrow so good night __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

FD	In the past I've used proxyquire/mockery to "hijack" node's require but I'm having a little difficulty getting that setup with typescript+ __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	ezra-quemuel: with jest (ts-jest) you can mock es6 modules __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	The trick/problem is that, when es6 modules imports are transpiled to commonjs require calls they are hoisted to the top of the file __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	babel-jest hoist your mock calls above the  require calls, but ts-jest doesn't support it yet.So what you can do is to put your jest.mock calls on a module and import first thing to your test file __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	ts-jest has other issues, like sometimes inaccurate coverage reports. but its working and super fast __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	So I'm trying to figure out a way to build images that arecompletedbuilds for my rails app deployments. I've basically read a bunch of stuff and come to the conclusion that I should create an image that has all my base dependencies like ruby version, nodejs, etc. Then i should create a dockerfile using that image as base, then copying over my 'tmp' directory that contains build cache, my 'node_modules' dir that contains previously downloaded javascript dependencies, and similarly so for my gems, and my javascript and image/css precompiled assets. After copying them into the image i can run my ruby 'build' tasks, then save all the new tmp, node_modules etc contents back to the host computer filesystem, and finish off the dockerfile. __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	If i'm not mistake this can give me very fast build times with minimal downloading etc and leads to a single image that I can spin up on any number of machines very quickly __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	does this approach make any sense? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	apologies for the lack of sensible terminology. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	if you want to leverage caching of build tasks, yes, that's the best solution. But to release a container for production, I usually remove build tools and ship the container with the minimum to run the service. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CC	I dont understand shipping containers __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	i thought you ship images, and when you run them you end up with a container on the host system __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	I think, I have something important to say.It's the second time that this happens with me. I install docker on Linux Mint and after some hours the disk is full. Dont know why this happens, but I found out one thing, that also happens these two times. I lost all my system backups (I use timeshift). I dont know if it's some kind of conflit, but I think I have to report this, because it's a shame. The last time I had to reinstall my system, because I couldnt even start the system. This time, when I realise I had just 6GB left, I deleted some stuff here to have at least 20GB free, then disconnect from internet, restart, delete all docker images (Yes, I installed yesterday and I downloaded 4 images) then uninstall docker, and the magic happens. 100GB free right now ... Someone tells me. How this is even possibel that docker uses 100GB ? I was watching the free space decreasing. C'mon. Fix that.

FQ	There are 2 types of health check. Local, where if unhealthy, just suicide(the HEALTHCHECK is a good candidate for that) and the distributed consensus, which is made by external sources trying to reach that container and failing, so they agree on ask docker to kill it __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hey guys, I have one last question around spark's word2vec implementation (newest version). Is there anyway to update existing weights, like the standalone word2vec version?

OQ	still struggling to grasp the concepts to design a RNN networklet\'s say I wanted to detect motions/swipes on "touch pad" that consists of n x n sensors that record the state at a given interval. The users obviously do not make the motions identically, including the speeds might be different. So, now I have two questions:1) should I use a single n x n conv layer as input? or should I use some mega large input that contains all the n x n frames until the slowest motion is completed?2) if I used just single n x n as input, how should the training labeling be done? logically it seems that the label should be when the motion is completed, that is in the end, but should the other frames from the first to the last frame also be labeled the same? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	daredemo: You could use a CNN to obtain a single vector representation and then feed that into an RNN. Another approach I think of is to capture touchpad "activation" in a single matrix and let them decay with each timestep, so that most recent values will be 1 and old values will be close to zero and then apply a CNN to that single matrix. The problem with tihs approach is that you would need to detect start and end (maybe with another net?) __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	Paranaix: "You could use a CNN to obtain a single vector representation", could you elaborate on this? do you mean by this that would build input layer that is m frames deep? [m x n x n] if my frame is [n x n ]? because this seems a bad idea, as it would require a lot of computing each step. some kind of hidden Markov model would be preferred, when I would only need to know the previous state, not m previous states __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FQ	but if I use the [ n x n ] input, I\'m then struggling with the "2)": how do I label my data?when the finger touches the middle of the touch pad, it could then move anywhere, up down left right; so it would seem strange to label it as "up" even if it is part of "up" motion... or should I? or should those intermediate steps be all classified as "meh?" :D or some intermediate classifier like "doing up" and only the end would be "up"? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	raver119: @agibsoncccOne Q. Today evening in my talk I'm planning to state that DL4J is the only FW capable of training NN in Jeff Dean Style Parameter Averaging on ApacheSpark (+ GPU support +support for all sorts of NN topologies) Is this correct? IMHO TensorFrames doesn't support parallel Parameter Averaging , correct? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	yup __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	so tensorframes only allows ETL __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
