OQ	@losorio2015_twitterHello guys, when I consult an observable, it emits me 2 timesThe first obsevable emptyAnd the second observable with date.How can I avoid it, just ask me 2 times?I just want you to consult me, the observable date@Dorusbefore you modifiy them (or just dont modify)https://files.gitter.im/ngrx/store/1q9N/blob __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I consult my observable state, with the operator select () __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	make a plunker. screenshots don't help anyone diagnose anything __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	@robwormald , I am only consulting my state, observable, with this lineThis.sub1 = this.store.select (fromRoot.getDocumentDialog);And I am emitting 2 times the observable. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I'm using the project, from the official app exampleHttps://github.com/ngrx/example-app __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	When I use the first () operator, it emits only once the observable one, but I get the observable void:This.sub1 = this.store.select (fromRoot.getDocumentDialog) .firts () __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	again. make a plunker. it is impossible to diagnose your code with you explaining it line by line, or posting screenshots __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

OQ	Okay Gentlemen,  We have a button that doesn’t get enabled until certain required fields are not ng-invalid and not ng-pristine.. We have to go there and manually update those fields to trigger the button to become active.  HOWEVER, we populate these select controls with VALID values on the ngInit event.  Why are they not being set to valid and touched then? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OP	 [<-CODE->] Why does mij startAnimation() function fire when the message.animationState is set to the 'first' state? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-CODE->] __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	are you sure it's not changing __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	like it has a default value and you're setting a different value right after __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	maybe because im setting the value to inactive __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	If i go from null -> active __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	if you're setting the value to inactive it shouldn't because you don't have transition that ends with inactive __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	it goes from opacity 0.5 to opacity 1 __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	without any transition, because you have not set it... __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
NF	ghetolay: indeed, but even if the state is null, the done function fires __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	on animation state null is also a transition... form void => inactive __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CQ	how can i set it up so that the done event does not fire? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-CODE->] __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	because this is not working __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	jordic: you sure the callback is always called ? even for non-defined animation ? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CQ	or can i sepicify on what transition the done event fires? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	not sure if is a feature or a bug ... but is the only way of explaining the situation... __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AE	perhaps you can check the event... I think it contains this kind of information... __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AC	Sure, so pass the event to a function __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PA	The callbacks receive an AnimationTransitionEvent which contains useful properties such as fromState, toState and totalTime. __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

OQ	is there a way to avoid the first router transition? I am using universal and the server renders the view. When the browser side angular kicks in. It starts with a transition animation. This look strange because universal already rendered the view. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hello, I am new in A2. I am trying to develop an app where users fill the search form and click search button , it sends request to API to get results. This search form is in one component and I want to display the search result in another component on the same web page. How can I make so that when I click search button in "searchform" component, the result will be displayed in "results" component ? I have searchservice to handle the http request. How can i make connection with search button to trigger to load the result lists in result component ? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	@sayedrakib If your components are siblings then try to send event to the parent component to initialize the results to some variable say <srch_results> and using the bindings for the results component set one to get <srch_results>  and do what ever you want with that data in your results component.You can do it via services, Observables too.But if the results is a child component then you can do it directly thinking a bit will give you the sol.And for more on this read about component interacion cookbook on angular 2 website.https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/component-communication.html __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

IG	so... it seems in AoT you can't useuseValuein a provider  if the value isn't known in compile time __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
CQ	Hmm. So you are saying instead of putting the component startup logic right in ngOnInit, put some subscribing-to-store block in ngOnInit so that the initialization logic can go in that subscribe block and therefore won't get fired until the store is ready? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hi All, I need to have a tabs in my app. each tab will load its own component. so there would be parent component which will have 3 tabs and each tab will load its own component when user clicks on it. any solution to achieve this ? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
JK	vishalgajjar: Exactly what you just said lol __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

FD	vishalgajjar: Lets say you have Component A with its child component, Component B, which will hold the tabs __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
