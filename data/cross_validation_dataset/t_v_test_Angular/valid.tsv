OQ	Hi, what do I need to do to get my typescript module which is hosted on my private github group to be used as a module dependancy for other projects from other users in my group?  I read that I should not put my .d.ts or my .js files in github, but they should be in my  module and the .ts files should not be in the module but should be in my github.  Publishing the module privately isn't an option sadly. __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	avik-so: and option you can consider (I'm not sure if the best one) is using git submodules and your users have relative imports to your submodule location. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	Hi guys. I am trying to combine angular 2 with .net mvc 5 and I seem to lack some basic understanding here regarding npm. I have so far only used angular2 combined with meteor so I didn't have to deal with this things...Do I need to have node.js on the server for deployment? Like locally in development I just install my packages with npm install etc. in node_modules. But for deployment I don't want to have node.js there, can I just bundle node_modules somehow or how does it work? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	bergben: I would assume where you are deploying would have node installed - for example on Heroku you provide build instructions and your package.json file and it does the rest.  I believe digital ocean works the same way.  I have not done it in a while so I am recalling this from memory __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	bergben: you need node at build time, and you should be deploying an archived tarball to production __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	I understand I need it at build time, but I would rather build it beforehand and then deploy the build. By now I am thinking about bundling the whole node_modules using [<-LINK->] and then just include that file... Do you think that would work? Or how do you mean "deploying an archived tarball", how would I do that@ljharb?@maxwellsmart84I know how it works for Heorku, unfortunately this project is for a company for a client on a custom server and communicating them to install node.js and npm then do npm install etc. just makes it complicated for them and should be avoided at all costs __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OP	Hi@all, I have a important question about the Interfacing in Typescript.Why does this example act like it does? Shouldn't test2,3 and 4 throw errors? [<-CODE->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	Z3roCoder: you should wrap your code in ``` __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so it's readable __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
UF	There we go :) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	interfaces aren't exclusive __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	they only require properties be there __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it doesn't care about extra properties __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	But in case 2 and 3, it requires exactly the properties in the interface __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	b is not in the interface, and this it complains that b shouldnt be there __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	return{a : 3 b:3}satisfies the interface __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	Look at my screenshot __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
NF	oh ... on object literals yeah __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	you need to do any on object literals if you want it to work __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So this is expected behaviour? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PF	yes __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's mostly designed for when you are passing object literals to function __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	When is, and when isn't, something a object literal in my example? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Isn't <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; also a object literal? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	yeah but then you are casting it specifically to an ITest __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So what's the difference then betweenreturn <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; andconst c: ITest = { a: 3, b: 3 } (This complains) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	what version are you using? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	2.1.4 __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	So the thinking is if you are setting extra properties you'll never be able to safely access them from the interface that you are assigning __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so the compiler assumes this is likely an error on your part __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	and you have to use type assertion to get around it __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	Why would this not apply to test4 then? This is basically the same example as test3, only that in this case, a Promise of the type ITest is returned __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	probably an edge case the compiler does not consider __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

IG	I\'m reading about the rnn stuff and it says "It is not possible to change the number of examples between calls of rnnTimeStep" __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
OQ	I'm trying to understand this: to make a prediction, I need the previous state, but if I call rnnClearPreviousState(), this clears the previous... which now allows me to use any number of examples I want... but because previous state was cleared... this means that I'm back in the beginning? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	let's say I have daily data, and I do at first 2 examples (days) at a time... after some time I've reached say Thursday and could predict Friday, but if I do rnnClearPreviousState(), then I'm back to Monday? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	it's pretty uncommon that you want to predict the next steps of some number of time series,andstart predicting for a new time series at the same time __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	it gets hard to track, too __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	in principle: you can manually set the state __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	it's just arrays, and adding more examples means a larger dimension 0 for the state __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
CQ	I mean is performance so critical that you really need to do that? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

FQ	AlexDBlack: I'm not yet even trying to optimize, I'm not sure what it is doing or supposed to be doing... for example, if I do single step, then I get next day, right? if I do say 2 examples/days, then I predict the day after tomorrow? or still just tomorrow? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FQ	so 3 examples would mean tomorrows prediction in 3 locations? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
