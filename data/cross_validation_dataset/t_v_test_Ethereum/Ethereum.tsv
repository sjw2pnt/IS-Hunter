OQ	Hi There, can someone help me restoring ethers ? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OP	I had trouble with the new version 0.8.7  it would not sync properly , it was syncing but was so slow it would never have cought up with it's self . I have now gone back to 0.8.6 .Could my problems have been due to the hard fork as that was the reason i updated to 0.8.7 ? Seeing as the Gethub site said the update was for those that use Mist and did not effect those that are just using the wallet as it does not access the internet. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I have read that others also had trouble syncing the new version 0.8.7 and that is the reason i stop trying with 0.8.7 and went back to 0.8.6 . I think it may follow the wrong Chain at block 1,346,??? not shore about that but the chain data started to bloat and get very big conpared to the size of the chain data that i currently have with 0.8.6 that was up to date as of about 36 hrs ago __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I also had trouble with 0.8.6 the first time . It would not sync . I then use Gerth and reved DB and then reloaded it the chain data with this command geth --fast --support-dao-fork --cache=512 --maxpeers 99 --jitvm and this worked __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Don't know what you have done but i am getting F-ing pissed off with the wallet not syncing and what the hell has the wallet downloaded new binary's ?????? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Geth folder now has to folders with binary's what the hell is the new binay for , i now have 3 versions of geth 2 in the folder Geth in there own folders and 1 version in the geth folder. So witch version is the correct one we should be using ????????????????????????????????????????? F-me you just can't help yourself but F-up every month or 2 can you ! __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	i am having the same issue but, be patient, i just got the latest geth version , try to install it and then start it.. it will start syncing __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

NF	just read the news so the chain split , well i can report i just ran the new grth and it's even worse the the origanal version that is loaded with 0.8.6 . In other words i don't think the patch is working . I am not using Mist just the wallet __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FQ	I ask again is it ok to delete empty accounts by deleting the key in the keystore folder and if i do that will it cause a problem ???? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	what's the bet the stuff up has been caused by Zcash being linked with ether it is the same group that''s released Zcash that is doing ether . __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	Zcash is not worth doing for those that see the big price and think they can earn some quick cash mining it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	gtx 970 using Nicehash cuda 8 gives only 19 sols , I have just run Zcash for 24 hrs with everything going  gtx 970 using cuda and 680 using open cl as it wont work with the cuda and 4 of 8 cores running got me 0.00501 Zcash  good luck with that one as it seems only big miners with heaps of cash to buy the latest CPU's and you will need at least 20 will be able to mine it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	ops the latest GPU's and you will need at least 20 will be able to mine it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	if you wish to do anonomous transcation then use Dash coin and don't worry about Zcash __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AE	you can mine Dash a lot easyer than Zcash and is more profitable too __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	Good night i will leave the wallet to sync as it does seem to be syncing but very slowly and the Chain data has grown by 1.3 gig for only aprox 3,200 blocks witch does not seem right , there is still 7,00 to go so i will check it in a few hours but i suspect that the patch does not work with 0.8.6 or does not do what you thought it would do __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	so i'll let it finish see how big the chain gets note it down and then redo the whole thing and see how big the chaindata folder is and let you know , if it is smaller then your patch is not working but i will let you know tomorrow so good night __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
