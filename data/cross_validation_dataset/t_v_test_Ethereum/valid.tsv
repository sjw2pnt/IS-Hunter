OP	quick question... __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
OP	is there a way to docker monitor if a service inside the container is alive or not? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I mean, the main ENTRYPOINT is alive, so from docker perspective, the container is running however, some internal crap happen on the app and I need docker to check with some sort of heartbeat the application (idk, a ping on a specific port or whatever) and if it does'nt reply, just kill the container... is it possible? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	need some health monitoring internal and external to the container; something internal to keep checking the status of what you need running/accessible, and something external to poll it once in a while to know to kill/restart it.... there's unfortunately so many ways to accomplish this, it just depends on what level of effort you want to put into it. __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	you could simplyexecaps | grep APPto see if it's running external from container on the host __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

CC	that is the poin __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	point __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	in Orleans we have a health monitoring service which all nodes of the cluster ping each other and after a given number of ping fail from some servers, they declare it dead, and remove from the cluster membership ring __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	it already works pretty fine on VMs and bare metal __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I did implemented an Docker membership provider __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem now is that for the provider, it only knows if a node is up or down only by checking docker daemon if it is up or down __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	and that is our problem __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FQ	a container can be app, but some internal thread in the application process for whatever reason is blocked __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so no new requests should go to that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so the idea is to ask docker (or swarm) to kill that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	but to be sure of that, I need to detect this stallness correctly __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	how is the provider checking daemon status? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

IG	if you are simply doing adocker ps | grep MY_CONTAINER_NAME | grep Runningor something of the nature, it's simple to also do something like:docker exec MY_CONTAINER_NAME ps aux | grep processordocker exec MY_CONTAINER_NAME ping somehost.com __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	in linux, you map docker.socket and you make docker API requests to it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	but on windows, there is no docker.socket!!! o.o __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	imo it's best to keep that check external to the container... i like to couple things downstream instead of upstream... but that's preference __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	we have this check external __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	each node of Orleans cluster (which is a container) send health messages to each other __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the rendevour point of those messages, used to be the membership table __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	if multiple nodes try to reach a node and fail (lets say 3 times), that node is marked as dead __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	even if the machine is running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so noone will send a message to it again __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	now, in docker, we don't have that table __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	we were relying on docker labels __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so each Orleans node should query docker (or swarm) daemon periodically about all the containers with a given Label that are running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	that would make them know who is on the cluster __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	if a container is killed/exit, next query on docker api will return all containers - that one __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	that is ok for periodic refreshes and consider only the container up or down __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is internal __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I need to mark a container as dead even if it is running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	could you then iterate over all the containers and exec a "health check" script that is consistently implemented? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CQ	even if it does NOTHING? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	the problem is not the healthcheck mecanism __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	we already have it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is how to mark it as dead __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	errr, other than just killing the container? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CQ	or can you modify a label? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	ok way, let me rephrase __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	i haven't messed with labels really outside of RancherOs __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is how to save the counted votes to kill that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hi guys. I am trying to combine angular 2 with .net mvc 5 and I seem to lack some basic understanding here regarding npm. I have so far only used angular2 combined with meteor so I didn't have to deal with this things...Do I need to have node.js on the server for deployment? Like locally in development I just install my packages with npm install etc. in node_modules. But for deployment I don't want to have node.js there, can I just bundle node_modules somehow or how does it work? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	bergben: I would assume where you are deploying would have node installed - for example on Heroku you provide build instructions and your package.json file and it does the rest.  I believe digital ocean works the same way.  I have not done it in a while so I am recalling this from memory __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	bergben: you need node at build time, and you should be deploying an archived tarball to production __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	I understand I need it at build time, but I would rather build it beforehand and then deploy the build. By now I am thinking about bundling the whole node_modules using [<-LINK->] and then just include that file... Do you think that would work? Or how do you mean "deploying an archived tarball", how would I do that@ljharb?@maxwellsmart84I know how it works for Heorku, unfortunately this project is for a company for a client on a custom server and communicating them to install node.js and npm then do npm install etc. just makes it complicated for them and should be avoided at all costs __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

CC	Z3roCoder: you should wrap your code in ``` __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so it's readable __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
UF	There we go :) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	interfaces aren't exclusive __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	they only require properties be there __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it doesn't care about extra properties __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	But in case 2 and 3, it requires exactly the properties in the interface __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	b is not in the interface, and this it complains that b shouldnt be there __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	return{a : 3 b:3}satisfies the interface __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	Look at my screenshot __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
NF	oh ... on object literals yeah __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	you need to do any on object literals if you want it to work __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So this is expected behaviour? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PF	yes __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's mostly designed for when you are passing object literals to function __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	When is, and when isn't, something a object literal in my example? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Isn't <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; also a object literal? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	yeah but then you are casting it specifically to an ITest __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So what's the difference then betweenreturn <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; andconst c: ITest = { a: 3, b: 3 } (This complains) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	what version are you using? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	2.1.4 __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	So the thinking is if you are setting extra properties you'll never be able to safely access them from the interface that you are assigning __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so the compiler assumes this is likely an error on your part __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	and you have to use type assertion to get around it __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	Why would this not apply to test4 then? This is basically the same example as test3, only that in this case, a Promise of the type ITest is returned __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	probably an edge case the compiler does not consider __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hi All, I'm having trouble with Appium 1.6.3, Xcode 8.2.1, and iOS 10.2.  I installed the new iOS driver XCUITest and now I am trying to get my tests to run in an iPad Air 2 simulator - or really any iOS 10+ simulator.  The simulator pops up, the new WebDriverAgent appears to start, but my app WILL NOT launch.  It tries to, but closes immediately.  I've tried almost everything and sort of at a loss.  Will post more details momentarily about how I built the app and appium logs.  If anyone can help though I would appreciate it!! __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	I can launch the app in the simulator from within Xcode, which is strange.  So I am wondering if there is some conflict or incorrect setup of the new automation drivers... __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	I think, I have something important to say.It's the second time that this happens with me. I install docker on Linux Mint and after some hours the disk is full. Dont know why this happens, but I found out one thing, that also happens these two times. I lost all my system backups (I use timeshift). I dont know if it's some kind of conflit, but I think I have to report this, because it's a shame. The last time I had to reinstall my system, because I couldnt even start the system. This time, when I realise I had just 6GB left, I deleted some stuff here to have at least 20GB free, then disconnect from internet, restart, delete all docker images (Yes, I installed yesterday and I downloaded 4 images) then uninstall docker, and the magic happens. 100GB free right now ... Someone tells me. How this is even possibel that docker uses 100GB ? I was watching the free space decreasing. C'mon. Fix that. Until there, I will be using docker on a virtual machine, because I cant trust this software anymore. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

IG	"feature" I think, as you also get to read people's messages instantly and when they make edits it sends a new message to your client rather than "fixing" the old one, so you can see everybody's dirty minds :D __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	also I don't understand how distributing images works. Ithinkwhat happens is that you 'push' an image to a repo, which is actually sending meta data + a bunch of layersafterchecking the repo to see if it already has those layers or not. As in it only sends up what it needs to __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	is that correct? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	well the scary part was the hacks I saw to get specific layers not to cache __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	which I undrestand busts everything after __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	siassaj: you are correct, if you are building on top of the same base layer for a specific image "repository" then it will already have that base layer if you have previous pushed an image to it, then it only has to transfer the newer/different layers __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	the autoencoder example is quite simple... so I have still plenty of questions. first of all, there are many types of autoencoders such as Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder, Contractive autoencoder... which does DL4J support?do I need to do something special to make an autoencoder that is  Denoising autoencoder, Sparse autoencoder, Variational autoencoder or Contractive autoencoder? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	variational autoencoder now available at current master __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	alex merged it few days ago __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	nice! __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	daredemo: There are small special things for each of the subtypes of autoencoders.  Sparse has a penalty (usually L1) which encourages sparse activation in the inner-most hidden layer.  Denoising adds noise on the input and attempts to reconstruct a noise free output.  Variational autoencoders instead learn a mean and standard deviation instead of an explicit internal state, then randomly generate a hidden state from those values and reconstruct. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	Of the bunch, denoising is perhaps the easiest to train, since you just had to do train(myExamples + noise, myExamples) __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

AE	the harmony flag is for broken features - if it was reliable in production, it'd be unflagged. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
AE	Harmony is for not-quite-production-ready features, horribly broken features get their own separate flags. It does have a bunch of memory leaks and bugs though, so don't use itin production. __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
AE	"production-ready" isn\'t a spectrum __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
