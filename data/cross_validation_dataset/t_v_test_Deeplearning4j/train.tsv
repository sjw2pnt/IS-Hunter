OQ	Hi guys, I have a simple question.  We can define some attribute in class likename?: stringwhich means that it may or may not be present. So is there any compiler flag or anything in typescript which will force me to do a type check before using it. For example handle the null case and to handle the case when name is a string? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	rajdeep26: Sortof. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	the closest would be turning on strict null checks __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	it won't catch every use, only mis-uses. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
CC	that will not force me to do a type check or empty check before using right? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	the type for an optional property likename?: stringwould bestring | undefined __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	so for example if you try to do [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	that would fail __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	sincestring | undefined is not assignable tostring __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	Also it would  prevent you from doing object WithOptionalName.name.length __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	without first doing a check for object WithOptionalName.name !== undefined __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
UF	Thanks@dtabuenc __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
PF	Pretty close to what i was looking. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	yes it's highly encouraged to have strict null checks on on any new project __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	harder sometimes to get an existing project up to a state where you can turn that on though __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	that's why it's not the default __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	ya, we just started with a new project a week back __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FD	no Implicit. Any no Implicit Returns no Implicit This strict Null Checks no Unused Locals no Unused Parameters no Fall through Cases In Switch __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

FD	Easier question.... for those looking to use docker for dev workflows that use hot reloading/auto reloading.... is there a best practise for node_modules folder? I mean the node_modules folder needs to be compiled on the container but conversely I need to setup a volume for the src so hot reloading works. Seems odd tonpm iinto a tmp folder in the dockerfile and then get docker-compose to copy that over into the host machine volume.

OQ	I am curious, when I want to deploy an image that I've built locally is it possible (or even plausible) to upload only that top application layer that's changed, and let my machines fetch the lower layers from cache? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AE	siassaj: I think the layers are introduced for reducing the payload during the uploads. So, the layers are automatically recognized and only those layers that are changed, will be sent as payload. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	Lakshman-LD: ok, that makes sense.  __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FD	i have 50 services per cluster, and about 12 clusters across the globe, and don't have any issues with having to track down ports __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FD	now __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	Hello, I am new in A2. I am trying to develop an app where users fill the search form and click search button , it sends request to API to get results. This search form is in one component and I want to display the search result in another component on the same web page. How can I make so that when I click search button in "searchform" component, the result will be displayed in "results" component ? I have searchservice to handle the http request. How can i make connection with search button to trigger to load the result lists in result component ? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	@sayedrakib If your components are siblings then try to send event to the parent component to initialize the results to some variable say <srch_results> and using the bindings for the results component set one to get <srch_results>  and do what ever you want with that data in your results component.You can do it via services, Observables too.But if the results is a child component then you can do it directly thinking a bit will give you the sol.And for more on this read about component interacion cookbook on angular 2 website.https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/component-communication.html __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OP	Hi@all, I have a important question about the Interfacing in Typescript.Why does this example act like it does? Shouldn't test2,3 and 4 throw errors? [<-CODE->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	Z3roCoder: you should wrap your code in ``` __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so it's readable __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
UF	There we go :) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	interfaces aren't exclusive __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	they only require properties be there __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it doesn't care about extra properties __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	But in case 2 and 3, it requires exactly the properties in the interface __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	b is not in the interface, and this it complains that b shouldnt be there __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	return{a : 3 b:3}satisfies the interface __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	Look at my screenshot __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
NF	oh ... on object literals yeah __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
IG	you need to do any on object literals if you want it to work __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So this is expected behaviour? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
PF	yes __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	it's mostly designed for when you are passing object literals to function __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	When is, and when isn't, something a object literal in my example? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Isn't <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; also a object literal? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	yeah but then you are casting it specifically to an ITest __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	So what's the difference then betweenreturn <ITest>{ a: 3, b: 3 }; andconst c: ITest = { a: 3, b: 3 } (This complains) __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CC	what version are you using? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	2.1.4 __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	So the thinking is if you are setting extra properties you'll never be able to safely access them from the interface that you are assigning __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	so the compiler assumes this is likely an error on your part __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	and you have to use type assertion to get around it __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FQ	Why would this not apply to test4 then? This is basically the same example as test3, only that in this case, a Promise of the type ITest is returned __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	probably an edge case the compiler does not consider __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
AC	Alright, i will write a issue about this then __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	Maybe then it will become clearer __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

FD	You could create a definition that sets the root class or whatever as :any __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0

CC	of course, I do also use freenode, but everyone loves gitter more than freenode. I especially like the public logging of channels Gitter does, which is something that freenode doesn't have or even encourage by default. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

AE	I wouldn't mind having some sort of bridge from Gitter to my freenode channel, which I already have public logging for. I would consider my logs to be canonical. I wouldn't care if Gitter logs the channel as well. It's more about having an easy way for people to jump into the channel and start talking. __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

AE	Yeah, I haven't quite been satisfied with the user experience so far. For now, I just stook up an instance of Shout so people have an easy way to connect to the freenode channel from a web browser. No freenode captcha, no having to think about which channel to join.

I also installed nginx as a container and served the nginx to Caddy to see if Caddy is proxying correctly. I get the welcome screen from nginx.

OP	quick question... __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
OP	is there a way to docker monitor if a service inside the container is alive or not? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I mean, the main ENTRYPOINT is alive, so from docker perspective, the container is running however, some internal crap happen on the app and I need docker to check with some sort of heartbeat the application (idk, a ping on a specific port or whatever) and if it does'nt reply, just kill the container... is it possible? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	need some health monitoring internal and external to the container; something internal to keep checking the status of what you need running/accessible, and something external to poll it once in a while to know to kill/restart it.... there's unfortunately so many ways to accomplish this, it just depends on what level of effort you want to put into it. __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	you could simplyexecaps | grep APPto see if it's running external from container on the host __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

CC	that is the poin __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	point __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	in Orleans we have a health monitoring service which all nodes of the cluster ping each other and after a given number of ping fail from some servers, they declare it dead, and remove from the cluster membership ring __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	it already works pretty fine on VMs and bare metal __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I did implemented an Docker membership provider __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem now is that for the provider, it only knows if a node is up or down only by checking docker daemon if it is up or down __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	and that is our problem __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FQ	a container can be app, but some internal thread in the application process for whatever reason is blocked __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so no new requests should go to that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so the idea is to ask docker (or swarm) to kill that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	but to be sure of that, I need to detect this stallness correctly __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	how is the provider checking daemon status? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	remember, i know nothing about Orleans, so my apologies for simpleton questions related to that __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

IG	if you are simply doing adocker ps | grep MY_CONTAINER_NAME | grep Runningor something of the nature, it's simple to also do something like:docker exec MY_CONTAINER_NAME ps aux | grep processordocker exec MY_CONTAINER_NAME ping somehost.com __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0

FD	but on windows, there is no docker.socket!!! o.o __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	imo it's best to keep that check external to the container... i like to couple things downstream instead of upstream... but that's preference __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	we have this check external __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	each node of Orleans cluster (which is a container) send health messages to each other __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the rendevour point of those messages, used to be the membership table __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	if multiple nodes try to reach a node and fail (lets say 3 times), that node is marked as dead __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	even if the machine is running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so noone will send a message to it again __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	now, in docker, we don't have that table __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	we were relying on docker labels __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	so each Orleans node should query docker (or swarm) daemon periodically about all the containers with a given Label that are running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	that would make them know who is on the cluster __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	if a container is killed/exit, next query on docker api will return all containers - that one __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	that is ok for periodic refreshes and consider only the container up or down __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is internal __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I need to mark a container as dead even if it is running __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	could you then iterate over all the containers and exec a "health check" script that is consistently implemented? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CQ	even if it does NOTHING? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	the problem is not the healthcheck mecanism __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	we already have it __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is how to mark it as dead __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
CQ	errr, other than just killing the container? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CQ	or can you modify a label? __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
CC	ok way, let me rephrase __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	i haven't messed with labels really outside of RancherOs __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	the problem is how to save the counted votes to kill that node __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
IG	so my knowledge there is low as well, other than you can kinda query against them __eou__	agent	0	0	0	0
FD	remember, before docker, we had that table as a central point __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	now I have labels __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OP	I had trouble with the new version 0.8.7  it would not sync properly , it was syncing but was so slow it would never have cought up with it's self . I have now gone back to 0.8.6 .Could my problems have been due to the hard fork as that was the reason i updated to 0.8.7 ? Seeing as the Gethub site said the update was for those that use Mist and did not effect those that are just using the wallet as it does not access the internet. __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
FD	I have read that others also had trouble syncing the new version 0.8.7 and that is the reason i stop trying with 0.8.7 and went back to 0.8.6 .

AC	Good night i will leave the wallet to sync as it does seem to be syncing but very slowly and the Chain data has grown by 1.3 gig for only aprox 3,200 blocks witch does not seem right , there is still 7,00 to go so i will check it in a few hours but i suspect that the patch does not work with 0.8.6 or does not do what you thought it would do __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
AC	so i'll let it finish see how big the chain gets note it down and then redo the whole thing and see how big the chaindata folder is and let you know , if it is smaller then your patch is not working but i will let you know tomorrow so good night __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

FD	The trick/problem is that, when es6 modules imports are transpiled to commonjs require calls they are hoisted to the top of the file __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

OQ	Hi guys. I am trying to combine angular 2 with .net mvc 5 and I seem to lack some basic understanding here regarding npm. I have so far only used angular2 combined with meteor so I didn't have to deal with this things...Do I need to have node.js on the server for deployment? Like locally in development I just install my packages with npm install etc. in node_modules. But for deployment I don't want to have node.js there, can I just bundle node_modules somehow or how does it work? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
IG	bergben: I would assume where you are deploying would have node installed - for example on Heroku you provide build instructions and your package.json file and it does the rest.  I believe digital ocean works the same way.  I have not done it in a while so I am recalling this from memory __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
IG	bergben: you need node at build time, and you should be deploying an archived tarball to production __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	I understand I need it at build time, but I would rather build it beforehand and then deploy the build. By now I am thinking about bundling the whole node_modules using [<-LINK->] and then just include that file... Do you think that would work? Or how do you mean "deploying an archived tarball", how would I do that@ljharb?@maxwellsmart84I know how it works for Heorku, unfortunately this project is for a company for a client on a custom server and communicating them to install node.js and npm then do npm install etc. just makes it complicated for them and should be avoided at all costs __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	I see it's on the roadmap but not for any specific version yet __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	So one other question, regarding npm publishing.If you include a .d.ts with a JS npm library, how would you handle fixes to types only? i.e., if the package version doesn't increment, I guess no one will get the updated types.But if the library has primarily JS users, they might not want the versioning noise of typescript definition fixes and the maintainers might not want to bump versions for just that. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

FD	for calling it. Because it seems like it does not get executed (don't get the "response" in the other end) __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

CC	I don't follow? :) It's binded to a Function? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	so if you have [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	Yes __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	then at it's simplest you just call it: [<-CODE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
PF	Sure __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CC	but it expects a parameter in the other end :) __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	that's the "value"-part __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

IG	Gacnt: yeah the @ is usually decorators, but they wouldn't typically be used like@vts.blah(1)They would typically be decorating a class, method, parameter, or something like that. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	I guess it could  be used that way if there was an objectvts that had a function blah( param1:number) that returned another function that would actually be the decorator __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
AE	In the code you linked.....vts.componentis a decorator provided by the  vue framework __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	a decorator is just a function that gets called when your class is declared. It gets passed in information about your class and can do whatever it wants. __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1

AE	but it doesn't seem to be used much. I'm also thinking about the use of npm for frontend modules. It seems like we are going to need to have better tracking of javascript version or we'll be in javascript version hell, or be stuck with publishing only es5 modules forever. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AE	protometa: I'm fine with es5 . But as an example of a variation - somereact-nativemodules are published as is and if you need to use them in other environments you need to use only single presetbabel-preset-react-native __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
AE	ewnd9: that works if you know a specific module or set of modules is pure es6 or es7 but seems like we need a more general solution for module consumers to know which version of javascript a module uses. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
AE	rather than making it a concern of newer modules to covert for older consumers the older consumers could just convert newer modules that they wish to use. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	So when I run a docker instance, my entrypoint runs some bootstrapping commands to sync dependancies (specifically php'scomposer install).  These dependencies are written to disk owned by root:root. Is there a way to tell docker (specifically docker-compose) to write files as the user I'm running docker as? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	Looks like docker-composer supports auserkey in the yaml file. I'll try it out, but it would be nice if there was an agnostic way to let all developers run the same config. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	sbbowers__twitter: typically this is construct you create inside your container that picks up the user running the container's ID and chown all the files inside the container to that user during the build __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FQ	dragon788: So the "standard approach" is to bake in "gosu" into all of your docker images by curling a binary off the net and then require your entrypoint to run the command through that, which gives you the option of passing an environment variable with the ID of your current user, all of which won\'t work with docker-compose. Do I understand that right? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	I think gosu is one way to do it, but really since it isn't recommended to run as root anyways, a lot of containers will chmod everything to a known user and run everything as that, the trick is whether that UID exists on your system or not __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FQ	So the easy way would to do auseradd -u {some arbitrary ID I pick} docker-useron the host and then pass that user ID to docker's -u? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	If I specify "docker-user" to docker, will it resolve the ID from the host, or does it do a useradd and create a new user? __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	So I'm trying to figure out a way to build images that arecompletedbuilds for my rails app deployments. I've basically read a bunch of stuff and come to the conclusion that I should create an image that has all my base dependencies like ruby version, nodejs, etc. Then i should create a dockerfile using that image as base, then copying over my 'tmp' directory that contains build cache, my 'node_modules' dir that contains previously downloaded javascript dependencies, and similarly so for my gems, and my javascript and image/css precompiled assets. After copying them into the image i can run my ruby 'build' tasks, then save all the new tmp, node_modules etc contents back to the host computer filesystem, and finish off the dockerfile. __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	hey guys, so I am wondering how you all manage your docker compose definitions, say I have an api, built in a microservice architecture, it results in something like 50+ docker compose services and I am wondering, if there is a better way to setup all these services using tools instead of hardcoded yml files on disk __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	I guess a nicer way would be through some interface, where I can build the configurations and house them in a tool which I could run, store them in a backend database, then I could manage them easier, any tools which you guys run that would help? or do you run everything using docker run? I guess not, cause multi service architectures would be a bit tricky to manage __eou__	user	0	1	0	0

OQ	Hi all, I've just re-written the history of the project I'm working on to purge all remnants of  previously checked in node modules. I've also chosen to use yarn with an offline cache. The only snag is node-sass, which requires a binding. It's not a problem locally, where I have internet access, but the build server is not online, and is therefore not able to download the binding. Does anybody know if it's possible to cache vendor bindings somehow? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0

OQ	I\'m developing an angular 2 app. So essentialy, if I run the app with "ng serve" all works fine, if I refresh the page (for example [<-LINK->] ) it works fine and angular recognizes the right route. The problem occurs when I build the app in a war and deploy it on wildfly with a different context path (ex. /myapp). At this point the routing navigation works fine but if I refresh the page I receive a "Not found error". My base href on index.html is <base href="."> I also tried with <base href="./myapp"> but in this case angular try to look for the resources under [<-LINK->] and not under [<-LINK->] Anyone have any idea on how to fix it? __eou__	user	0	0	0	0
