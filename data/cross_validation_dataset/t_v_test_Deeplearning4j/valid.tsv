OQ	Hi, what do I need to do to get my typescript module which is hosted on my private github group to be used as a module dependancy for other projects from other users in my group?  I read that I should not put my .d.ts or my .js files in github, but they should be in my  module and the .ts files should not be in the module but should be in my github.  Publishing the module privately isn't an option sadly. __eou__	user	0	1	1	2

OQ	hey guys I am using angular 2 as my client side , express +node at server and want to use firebase as my db ,, so hw can I get started?? __eou__	user	0	1	1	2
FD	when i try to retrieve the data.name from my server i dont get the value: __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	res.json({name:['ayz','s'],work:['web app dev','front end dev']}); __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	i need to retireve data.name in my client side... when i retrieve name i get it but how can i retrieve data.name __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
CQ	AyzPat: can you explain better "i need to retireve data.name in my client side... when i retrieve name i get it but how can i retrieve data.name"? __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CC	fox1t: i have a plukr with basic files not exactly working one.. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	 [<-LINK->]  __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	*ngFor="let data of data"? maybe change the name of local var to not clash with data __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CC	@fox1tits not a problem on the client side, the problem is in res.json() __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	fox1t: m new to node so not getting how to send the information __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	res.json({name:['ayz','s'],work:['web app dev','front end dev']}); <-- this is ok __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
FD	try to query the route with postman and check if the returned object's props __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
CQ	fox1t: then why is data.name or say user.name is not getting retrieved it gives an error: Cannot find a differ supporting object '[object Object]' of type 'ayz,s'. NgFor only supports binding to Iterables such as Arrays. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	Cannot find a differ supporting object '[object Object]' of type 'ayz,s'. NgFor only supports binding to Iterables such as Arrays. __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
FD	on queryin to postman i got this:{"name": ["ayz","s"],"work": ["web app dev","front end dev"]} __eou__	user	0	1	0	0
IG	so nodejs part is ok, as you can see __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	the problem is inside client side code __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	i am not angular2 ninja, but i suppose you have to find a way to convert your data to array.  Maybe here: [<-ISSUE->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	ok here is the answer: [<-LINK->]  __eou__	agent	1	1	0	1
FD	this one is your issue, see problem 1 __eou__	agent	0	1	0	0
